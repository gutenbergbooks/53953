<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_1'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was just daybreak; the air was calm, and the
whole face of nature was shrouded in a light and
silvery mist. Presently the mist became agitated
by a fitful breeze; rays of light, faint at first, but
every moment becoming brighter in their hue, penetrated
it from the eastern horizon, and at length
gathering its folds, it prepared to follow the path of
the ascending sun. As it lifted, it disclosed a scene
upon which the eye of man delights to dwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An island, clothed with luxuriant foliage and redolent
with the perfume of the tropics, lay sleeping
on the crystal waters. On its southern side, the
unruffled waves of a sheltered bay, broke with a
murmuring sound upon a white and shelving beach.
At the foot of this bay, embowered in a grove, was a
small cluster of houses, whose white-washed walls,
seen through the interlacing branches of the trees,
many of the last laden with their golden fruit, looked
the fit abodes of charity and domestic peace. The
flickering airs, soft and fragrant as the breath of
beauty, fanned the pale and attenuated cheek of an
invalid, who, seated at the foot of a cotton-tree, looked
wistfully to seaward. A boundless expanse of ocean,
its undulating surface checkered with the prolonged
shadows of detached and scarcely moving clouds
alone met his anxious gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside him, with a look as wistful as his own, but
fixed on his wasted features, stood a young and lovely
female. Unconscious of her presence, he seemed
lost in revery, and the silence was for some moments
unbroken—for they were busied with the
thoughts most congenial to the nature of each—his
of active exertion and the strife of men; while hers,
disinterested and pure, and true to the instinct of her
sex, dwelt only on <span class='it'>his</span> hopes, <span class='it'>his</span> prospects, and <span class='it'>his</span>
future happiness. With a sigh, she broke the silence,
and laying her hand gently upon his head, she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Edward! why this anxiety to leave us?
Why this yearning for the sea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, dearest Mary!” said he, looking up, “I
knew not that you were near. Sit down, dear girl,
and I will tell you my little history. It will be the
best answer to your question, and your trustful nature
deserves implicit confidence. You know,”
said he, as she complied, and placed her hand in his,
“you know that I am in the naval service of our
country, and that the captain of the ship to which I
belong, sent me ashore here some two months since,
at the recommendation of the surgeon; and you
know, too, that your father, finding that I was connected
with some friends of his own in the United
States, invited me to his house, where, like a ministering
angel, you have wooed me from the embrace
of death. This, save my unbounded gratitude and
love, is all you know, and unsuspicious of others
as you are yourself confiding, hoping like an angel,
and believing what you hope, you have sought to
learn nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no parents,” he proceeded to say, “and
of a large family of children, I am the sole survivor.
My father died when I was yet an infant; in my
fourteenth year I lost my mother, and in the intervening
time, one by one, my brothers and my sisters
fell, all swept off by that insidious destroyer, whose
victims waste away, even while the cheek is flushed
and the eye brilliant with anticipations of renovated
health and years of enjoyment. Oh, Mary! that
you could have seen and known my sister—for she
was near your present age, and in many things you
much resemble her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have loved her dearly, Edward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could not have helped it, for she was one
of the purest, gentlest beings I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Describe her to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is impossible, for, graceful as a fawn and
with spirits buoyant and elastic, her features, at
one moment gleaming with hope, and the next,
subdued in sympathy, were changeable as the
aspects of the summer cloud, but beautiful in all
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
its changes—for the light it reflected was borrowed
from heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hers, then, was the beauty of expression.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of angelic expression, and yet her countenance
was exquisitely lovely in repose. It reminded
one of an inland lake, which, when serene and undisturbed,
reflects the flowers and the foliage around
it; but, when agitated, the shadows on its surface,
the tiny crests of foam and mimic waves brattling on
the shore, all its wild and shifting beauties are its
own. She died on an early summer’s morning, the
dew-drop yet sparkling on the blade which, while it
bent, it fertilized; and the whole earth, in one gush
of fragrance, sent up its tribute to the mighty hand
that made it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Edward! it were happiness thus to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, dearest, it is only a spirit pure and spotless
as your own, that can realize that death has no terrors
where life has no reproaches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pressure of the hand was her only reply, for his
eyes were filled with tears, and she felt too much
moved to speak. After a slight pause he proceeded.
“In less than twelve months, my mother followed her
to the grave, and the day and the hour, the occasion
and the scene, are deeply graven in my memory;
but,” he continued, observing her emotion, “I will
not distress you with the sad recital, although the sorrows
of that bitter hour were not without their
solace—for, feeling that our loss would be her
gain, the showers and the sunshine, the alternate
gloom and brightness of the day without, were typical
of our hopes and fears. My patrimony was considerable,
and my mother had named a distant relative
and seemingly attached friend as her executor
and my guardian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few weeks found me under the roof of Mr.
Thornton. The exchange was a sad one. I had left
the home of my infancy, where every familiar object
was associated with some kindly phrase or act
of endearment, to become a member of a proud
aristocratic family, which traced its lineage from
England. I could have endured privations without
repining, but I was peculiarly sensitive of neglect,
and was like the vine cast from the trunk which had
supported it, whose tendrils, unsustained and drooping,
are swayed to and fro by the wind, seeking for
something whereupon to cling. Repelled by the
cold indifference of the family, my yearning nature
found the sympathy it needed in the friendship of
Mr. Winchester, who was employed as a private
tutor for Mr. Thornton’s children. Above all men I
have ever seen, he united the wisdom of the serpent
with the simplicity of the dove. Placed under his
tuition, I made rapid progress, he was pleased to
say, not only in the acquisition of knowledge from
books, but in that more difficult branch which teaches
us to analyze our feelings, and to know ourselves.
You remember Mr. Hamilton, who left here shortly
after my arrival?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I do, and esteem him highly, for he is a
most excellent man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, imagine him a little taller, a shade more
pensive, somewhat more retiring in his manners,
and with an enunciation yet more distinct, and you
have Mr. Winchester before you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see him—and with the character you give, feel
that I could love him too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, that you would, for his meek exterior concealed
a spirit incorruptible as that of Brutus, and
as benevolent as Howard himself. To him I am
indebted for all that I am or can ever hope to be.
At that time politics ran high; Napoleon, the great
human vulture, was gorging himself with the blood
of nations, and the blood-red flag of England claimed
the empire of the seas. The discordant clamor of
party strife was loud and vehement, and the whole
country seemed to vibrate with the throes of political
convulsion. Warped by his pride of descent, and
giving the tone to his family, at Mr. Thornton’s fireside,
in all political discussions, the cause of England
was strenuously maintained. It was here that,
as I grew older, I derived the greatest benefit from
the counsels of Mr. W. A pure patriot, without a
parade of zeal, he ever upheld the cause of his
country. Pointing out the distinction between the
governments of Europe and the one we had adopted,
how the former strove to maintain an idle and luxurious
class in exclusive privileges, while the other
recognized no difference between man and man, he
ingrafted in me an attachment to our institutions as
warm and enduring as his own. But for him, I
might have imbibed the alien feelings of the family
with which I was domesticated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the close of my second year under his
tuition, news came of the wanton attack upon, and
inglorious surrender of the Chesapeake. At Mr.
Thornton’s table that day, much was said of the
valor of the English, and the craven spirit of the
Americans. Mr. Winchester mildly but firmly defended
his countrymen; but his opposition provoked
such a torrent of abuse, and such violent denunciations
of every thing pertaining to America, that,
interrupting Mr. Thornton in his loudest tirade, he
announced his determination of forever quitting a
house which he considered as a fit shelter only of
foes and traitors. A violent outbreak seemed inevitable,
but his calm and lofty demeanor quelled the
rising storm; and, true to his word, he left the next
morning. After his departure, the last tie that bound
me to the spot was severed, and I applied to be sent
to college. To my surprise, Mr. Thornton declined,
and threw out some vague hints of an unpaid bond
and a threatened lawsuit that might involve my
whole estate. I then asked to be sent elsewhere to
school, but was again denied. I therefore determined,
hap what might, to leave the place, and make
my way to one of the Atlantic cities, where, in the
sanguine spirit of youth, I felt sure of achieving
something. Any thing was preferable to the life there
before me. I had read of perilous escapes, and in
my inexperience, confounding my situation with that
of some imaginary captive, and fearing a thousand
obstacles, I waited impatiently for a tempestuous
night. It came at last, wild and terrific to my heart’s
content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throughout the day the weather had been variable.
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
At one time the tops of the trees were bowed down
by fitful gusts, while at another the wind gently
soughed among the branches, or dying away calm,
every thing would droop with the oppressive heat.
The clouds, low, detached and ragged, seemed to
hover over us. The bold and craggy tops of the
mountains were wreathed in mist, and the same
humid vapor filled the chasms and swept down the
distant slopes. Even before the sun disappeared, his
disc became lurid; the air seemed to thicken and
respiration was difficult. The untended cattle went
lowing to their pens, and the poultry, with discordant
noises, hurried under cover. About dusk,
a dense bank of cloud gathered in the north-west,
and while the thunder muttered in the far-off mountains,
it slowly approached us, the lightning playing
across it in incessant flashes. Suddenly, like the
smoke of artillery, a number of jets were thrown out
from its upper surface, and then a flash, compared
to which, those were as artificial fire-works which
had preceded it, blinded the eye, and instantly every
animate thing shrunk with dread as a most terrific
crash pealed upon the ear. Then came the whirl
and the roar of a tempest. The spirit of the storm
was abroad, and Omnipotence seemed, “to ride on
the wings of the mighty wind.” Huge trees and
massive fragments of rock were whirled about like
gossamer in a summer’s breeze. An avalanche of
rain followed, the very flood-gates of heaven seeming
to have opened above us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The long wished-for hour had now arrived,
and bracing myself to the desperate chance, I threw
a change of raiment into a wallet I had prepared, and
hurried forth, preferring rather to encounter the battling
elements than abide with those I could not love.
Breasting the driving rain, I shouted with exultation
at the prospect of achieving my own fortune by my
own exertions. Although ‘from cliff to cliff the
rattling crags among,’ I heard ‘the live thunder’
leaping, and the forked lightning almost seethed
the brain with its sharp and sulphurous fire. I
pressed on regardless of the storm and only fearful
of pursuit. For some miles the road, which ran
winding among the hills, was overflowed, and each
indentation in the mountains had become the bed of
a foaming torrent. I was obliged to clamber the
hill-sides, and spring from ledge to ledge across the
mad and plunging streams. But that I was in full
health, buoyant with hope, and of an elastic frame,
I could never have overcome the difficulties or survived
the perils of that night. Once or twice I
nearly despaired, but the prospect of the unfeeling
treatment to which I would be subjected if I returned
determined me to persevere. After severe toil I
gained the high-road, and threw myself down exhausted.
I had done so but a few minutes, when,
borne upon the wind, I heard a loud clatter, and
now and then a shrill and piercing shriek. Springing
to my feet, I gazed anxiously up the road. The rain
had partially subsided, and a momentary luminous
spot in the heavens, showed the position of the moon;
the thunder, no longer near, reverberated in the distance,
and the glare of the lightning, although less
frequent, was no less sulphurous and blinding. I
could soon distinguish the tramp of horses at full
speed, and in an instant after, a carriage passed at
headlong velocity. The screams I had heard, satisfied
me that there was at least one person within, and
I breathlessly hurried after it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A short distance below, the road descended a hill
and crossed a stream, ordinarily wide and shallow,
but now, doubtless, swollen and scarcely fordable.
My fears were more than realized, for to my dismay,
I soon found myself up to the armpits in the
water. The screams had ceased, and I could hear
nothing to guide me. Suddenly, through the lurid
gleaming of the storm, I saw the carriage, which
seemed to be entangled with something, while the
horses, rearing and plunging, madly strove to free
themselves from the harness. With some difficulty
I swam to it; the lateral pressure of the water almost
bearing me under by its velocity. I found that the
carriage had taken against a prostrate tree, and that
the struggles of the horses would soon precipitate it
over on its side. Fortunately, I had my hunting-knife
with me, and swimming round, contrived to
cut the traces and liberate the horses, but not without
receiving a severe kick on my right shoulder.
Forcing open the door, I found a female form within,
but whether alive or dead, in the uncertain light I
could not tell. The water was nearly up to the seat,
and rising with great rapidity. Bearing the body
up, I hesitated what to do. With a bruised limb, and
supporting a lifeless form, it would be madness to
attempt to swim. Feeling about, I discovered that
the front panel was a large one, and forcing it out,
dragged the wet and dripping figure through, and
placed her on the driver’s seat, while I loudly called
for help. Almost simultaneous with my own, I
heard voices shouting along the road, and guided by
my call, assistance was soon procured, and the lady
(who had fainted) rescued from her perilous position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Stephens, a respectable merchant, was, with
his wife, returning from the springs, and had reached
the village soon after the storm set in. He had just
alighted, and was holding forth his hand to assist Mrs.
S. to descend, when the horses, blinded by a flash of
lightning and terrified by the peal which succeeded
it, ran off at full speed, and the driver in his effort
to recover the reins, fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. S. expressed so much gratitude for my
efforts, and so frequently proffered his services to
aid me if he could, that, melted by his tones of kindness,
I confided to him the secret of my flight and all
my future plans. He listened with deep attention,
and endeavored at first to persuade me to return to
my guardian, but finding my repugnance insuperable,
he suggested a mode of enfranchisement at the bare
mention of which my heart fairly leaped for joy.
He proposed that I should enter the navy, a profession,
he remarked, which, although little esteemed
by the country, would, he felt sure, if an opportunity
offered, gain for itself a high and imperishable renown.
Informing my guardian of the course intended
to be pursued, he exerted his influence, and
in a short time procured me an appointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
“I made but one cruise previous to the war. Immediately
after its declaration, I was ordered to the
frigate Constitution, then lying at Annapolis. She
was commanded by Captain Hull, who, with every
officer and man on board, was exceedingly anxious
to get to sea before the enemy should reach the
<a id='chesapeake'></a>Chesapeake in superior force. Our captain had twice
ineffectually written to the Secretary of the Navy,
urging permission to proceed to sea. At length he
called up the officer of marines and said to him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Have you no business that calls you to headquarters?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘None, sir,’ replied the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Then you must make some,’ said the captain,
and handing him a letter, added, ‘you will start this
evening so as to reach Washington early to-morrow.
When you get there, let it be your first business to
call upon the Secretary of the Navy and give him
this letter, telling him at the same time, that you will
call in three hours for a reply. At the expiration
of the three hours, be sure to take your departure,
and I expect you to breakfast with me the morning
after.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The officer strictly obeyed his instructions.
When the Secretary had read the captain’s letter, he
remarked ‘I am very much occupied at present, sir,
but if you will call in two or three days, I will have
an answer ready for you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Sir,’ replied the officer, ‘I am allowed but three
hours in Washington to see my colonel, and at two
o’clock I am to start on my return.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Very well, sir,’ was the reply; and he took his
leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At two punctually, he called again, and the
Secretary, somewhat fretted, said, ‘Really, sir, I
have not had time to attend to Captain Hull’s letter,
can you not wait until to-morrow?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Under my present orders, sir, it is impossible.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Very well, say to Captain Hull that I will write
to him by mail.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Excuse me, sir,’ said the officer, ‘when I
assure you that the captain will be bitterly disappointed
if I do not bring something from you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a gesture of impatience the Secretary drew
a sheet of paper toward him, and writing a few
hurried lines, handed the note to the officer, who
took his departure. It contained these remarkable
words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—You will proceed with the Constitution
to New York, and should you meet any vessels of
the enemy, you will note it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was sufficient, and we immediately weighed
anchor and stood to sea. A short distance out, we
encountered a squadron of the enemy, and the chase
that ensued has already become matter of history.
Of the fatigue we underwent, and the unsurpassed
exertions we made, I can give you no idea. For
most of the time the wind was light, and occasionally
it subsided to a perfect calm. At such times
the sun, fierce and fiery, scorched us with the intensity
of his blaze; while towing and kedging, our
crew toiled manfully and without a murmur: with
the perspiration streaming from their brows, no one
dreamed of relaxation. Each one, sleeping at his
post, caught his meals as he could. At one time,
the nearest ship, being towed by all the boats of the
squadron, was enabled to gain fast upon us, notwithstanding
our redoubled and almost superhuman exertions.
The surface of the ocean, unmoved by
undulation, and smooth as a mirror, reflected the
black and threatening hulls of our pursuers. Gradually,
like huge, creeping monsters, they seemed all to
gain upon us, when, at the very crisis of our fate, a
catspaw, faint as a fleeting shadow, darkened a spot
upon the water, and then disappeared, leaving no
trace behind; again, another, and another, imperceptibly
increasing in extent and force, until commingling
into one, and rippling the ocean with its
breath, the light but glorious breeze came on. Swinging
the ponderous yards to meet its glad embrace, we
thanked our God that we were the first to feel it.
The sails, late so listless and inactive, first flapped
exultingly, and then slowly distending, our noble
ship, in all her grace and pride and beauty, like a
recruited steed, renewed the race she had so nearly
lost. With sail on sail, packed wide and high, from
the bulwarks to the trucks, each ship was soon a
pyramid of canvas. Behind us was captivity or
death—before us freedom, and perchance renown.
Judge, then, with what thrills of delight we soon
perceived that we were leaving our pursuers. The
wind freshened as the night closed in, and early the
ensuing day the enemy abandoned the chase as hopeless.
For sixty hours we had toiled unceasingly,
and human nature had been taxed to the utmost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut off from New York, our commander determined
to proceed to Boston. Off Long Island we
spoke an American vessel, and by her the captain
wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, acquainting him
with his escape, and informing him that he would
proceed to Boston, where he trusted to receive permission
to cruise at sea. We reached the harbor
late one evening, by midnight we had commenced
taking in provisions and water, and in twenty-four
hours were ready for sea. For three days beyond
the time we should have heard from Washington,
we were kept in the most anxious suspense. All
hands were detained on board except the purser,
who, on the arrival of each mail, hurried to the
post-office, in the hope of finding the desired letter.
On the third day there did come an official letter, but
it was addressed to a ward-room officer on the subject
of his pay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then that Captain Hull took a resolution
which evinced as much wisdom as moral courage.
He knew that the cruisers of the enemy swarmed
upon our coast, and he chafed with impatient desire
to fairly encounter one of them. He determined to
put to sea without orders, and immediately carried
his purpose into execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had soon the satisfaction to meet an adversary.
It was one of the ships belonging to the
squadron which had chased us. Instead of increasing
we now sought to lessen the intervening distance,
and as we approached, each ship, like a combatant
in the arena, partially stripped herself for the conflict.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
Under reduced sail, leisurely, deliberately, we
neared each other. It was a moment of intense
excitement. England had so long styled herself the
mistress of the seas, and the arrogance of the claim
was so lessened by her almost uninterrupted career
of victory, that the boldest and most sanguine among
us admitted probability of defeat. Yet there was no
shrinking of the nerve, not one instant’s hesitation of
purpose. Our country had sent us forth, and in the
hour of peril she relied upon us. We knew that we
might be defeated, but felt that we could not be disgraced.
The flag, with the proud vessel which bore
it, might sink beneath the waves, or with it, by one
terrific explosion, be scattered in shreds and fragments
upon its surface, but each one felt that it could
never be struck to a single adversary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had thought before that I had some idea of a
battle, but imagination fell short of the stern and
startling reality. Men, lately so calm, collected,
and seemingly almost impassive, were wrought to
the highest pitch of frenzy, and reeking with perspiration,
and begrimed with powder, as seen through
the fire and the smoke, appeared like infuriated demons.
The ship, reeling like a drunken man, quivered
with each recoil, but there was no screaming, no
shouting—the ministers of death were too earnest for
noisy exhibition, and except the stifled groans of the
wounded, and the brief, quick words of command,
the human voice was unheard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the result. At the report of the last
gun in that conflict, as at the blast of the Israelite
trumpets before Jericho, the walls of British invincibility
fell—like them, too, never to rise again. But,
dearest, I tire you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Edward, I love to listen to you. When I
first read of that victory I wept for joy. Now,
although it is past, I tremble, while I rejoice, at the
danger you incurred; but tell me, did you escape
unhurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I received a flesh wound merely, but it proved
irritable and difficult of cure. In consequence, I was
prevented from again sailing in the ship; but my
promotion was secured, and I congratulate myself
on my present position. The ship to which I am
attached is smaller than the Constitution, but she is
well-manned and ably commanded. There is no
telling at what moment she may meet with an opponent;
and you, dearest, would not have me absent
while my shipmates are battling for our country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Edward, I will not be less patriotic than
yourself; but we have so shortly known and understood
each other, that it is hard to separate so soon,
and when there is so much danger that we may never
meet again; beside, your impatience retards your
recovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear not, Mary, the fever has entirely left me,
and my strength increases daily—thanks to your
gentle nurture, for, unseen, though hovering near,
you not only supplied my wants but anticipated
every wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak of it no more, Edward; see, Alfred is
coming to call us to breakfast. I will take the path
through the shrubbery and avoid him, or he will
have his jest at our expense when we meet at table.”
Springing from her lover’s side as she spoke, she
lingered for an instant as she gained the copse, and
turned with a fond, confiding glance toward him, but
the sound of her brother’s footsteps checked the
current of her feelings, and she was out of sight in
an instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Talbot was in his 22d year. With a
fine figure, his frame indicated more activity than
strength. His hazel eye, undimmed by recent illness,
expressed decision of character, and his dark hair
fell in untrimmed luxuriance over his pale but manly
features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary Gillespie was eighteen, and almost a woman.
About the medium stature of her sex, her light,
elastic figure moved in unconscious grace. Her
silk-like chestnut hair shaded a neck of snowy
whiteness; her brilliant cheek, now white as a lily,
now mantled with a blush, more surely and more
rapidly than words bespoke the current of her feelings;
while her deep-blue eyes, bathed in liquid
crystal, and curtained from the sight by their long
and fringing lashes, rarely raised and as suddenly
withdrawn, struck the beholder with wonder and
admiration. Beautiful in person, sensitive in her
feelings, and of a most confiding and affectionate
nature, she was a being formed for love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gillespie was a merchant who had resided
eight years upon the island, and for the last three
held the situation of American Consul. The war
having interrupted his business, he had been for
some time winding up his affairs preparatory to
returning home. He was an unpretending man,
of practical good sense and sterling integrity. He
had been five years a widower. Left with two
children he had devoted every leisure hour to their
education. But his son, now in his 14th year, proved
more intractable than the daughter, and increased
his anxiety to return and place him under the charge
of competent teachers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the state of things when Lieutenant
Talbot was sent on shore extremely ill. At first, in
his province as consul, Mr. Gillespie had procured
for him the best lodgings that could be hired; but
when he heard his mother’s name, and found that
through her the young officer was related to an old
and cherished friend, he at once had him removed to
his own house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not to be expected that, under such circumstances,
two kindred spirits should meet and not assimilate.
It is no wonder that thus thrown together,
they should become mutually attached. They did
love! love only as those can do who, trustful in their
natures, are uncankered by care, and in their thoughts,
their prayers, their aspirations, and their dreams,
they soon become each other's constant and abiding
theme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning after the one with which this tale
had opened, Mr. Talbot threw open his casement,
and stepping into the balcony, looked eagerly toward
the west. It was again calm, and the unclouded
sun, just risen, threw his unrefracted rays
across the slumbering sea. It was Sunday, all was
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
silent, and not a vestige of a living thing was seen.
Not a solitary bird fanned the air, no roaming fish
disturbed by its gambols the mirror-like surface of
the deep, but on the furthest verge of the horizon,</p>

<p class='noindent'>floated a light and buoyant fabric, which alone,
within the broad scope of vision, proclaimed man as
its architect. It was the Hornet, the symmetrical
Hornet, already renowned for a glorious achievement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few hours the sea breeze set in, which, cool
and refreshing, is sent by a merciful Providence to
temper the heat of a tropical sun. The ship was
soon under a cloud of canvas, and it was a beautiful
thing to see her inclined to the breeze, dashing along
with graceful speed, while the light tracery of her
rigging was reflected upon the sails which looked
snow-white in the glancing beams of the sun. As
if instinct with life, she bounded across the water,
and soon dropped her anchor in the bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Biddle, already distinguished for his gallantry,
together with several of his officers, dined
with Mr. Gillespie that day. Before midnight, they
were again at sea, for there were enemies abroad,
and they felt bound to seek them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It were useless to dwell upon the parting interview
of the lovers. All that the gushing fondness
of two such natures could impart was interchanged.
Hap what might, though distance should separate,
and circumstances debar their intercourse for months
or years, they felt that unswerving confidence which
true and loyal breasts alone can feel. It is true that
they both felt much anxiety—the maiden in especial,
for her lover was exposed to far more than the perils
of the deep. But, with a faith early instilled by the
precepts of a pious mother, she placed her trust on
High, and with more of hope than fear, looked forward
to the future.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_2'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For some weeks the Hornet sought in vain for a
cruiser of the enemy. Some valuable captures were
made, and the vessels destroyed, and it was determined
to shift the cruising ground to the South
Atlantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they approached the equator, the atmosphere
became humid and oppressive, and they were deluged
with frequent rain, compared to which the
heaviest showers of our own more favored clime,
are as the dew-drop to the overflowing cistern.
Often at night the sea would be brilliantly phosphorescent, and
the water as dashed aside by the
advancing prow, fell over in curls of flame, while,
gamboling around in very wantonness, myriads of
porpoises, the dolphins of antiquity, sportively
chased each other, and darting to and fro, without
design or order, checkered with lines of light the
dark, unruffled sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day on which they crossed the line was preceded
by a night of surpassing loveliness. Undisturbed
and quiet as a sleeping infant, the calm and
placid ocean lay in beautiful repose, its very heavings,
as if moved by the modulation of sweet sounds,
so gentle, as not to impair the reflections of its
mirror-like surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward morning, a mist arose, which, becoming
dense, settled down and banked around the horizon.
As the night waned, faint streaks of light tinged the
dark cloud; gradually the hues became brighter and
more expanded, the violet became purple, the purple
reddened into crimson, and suddenly, as from a bed
of flame, the sun looked forth upon the quiet scene.
The serene sky, the placid ocean, the soft breath of
the morning, and the gorgeous sun, were all in keeping
with the attributes of their Maker; while the
tiny ship, a mere speck upon the waters, girdled with
iron and prepared for strife, was a fit emblem of the
frailty and insignificance of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inconsiderate and the thoughtless were disappointed
that the usual ceremony of receiving
Neptune was dispensed with on crossing the line;
but the Hornet was too well disciplined for such a
disorderly exhibition, and her commander wisely
considered the custom of roughly shaving the uninitiated
as one more honored in the breach than the
observance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After crossing the equator, the atmosphere improved
and became balmy and pleasant, and <span class='it'>so</span> rarified
that the stars became visible at the very verge of
the horizon. The pole star, the lamp hung out in
heaven to guide the wanderer on the northern deep,
although steadfast as faith it maintained its post, gradually
disappeared, and others, more brilliant but
less endeared by association, rose upon the view.
High up in the heavens, two luminous bodies, like
fragments of the milky way, became visible, while
lower down toward the pole, another of darker hue
was seen. They were the wonderful Magellan
clouds which, from their position and immovability,
are supposed by Humboldt to be the reflections of
the Cordilleras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The messmates of Talbot had soon perceived a
marked change in his demeanor: His hilarity was
gone, and, avoiding his former associates, he paced
the deck or sat apart, wrapped in the visionary aspirations
of a lover. They all suspected the cause, but
had too much regard for him to wound his sensitive
feelings by ill-timed jests and allusions. Indeed
their respect for him insensibly increased, for they
perceived with surprise that although completely absorbed
in revery when he had no duty to perform,
yet he had become the most vigilant among them,
and in particular paid the most minute attention to
the exercise of his division at the guns and in the use
of small arms. At such times, his eyes sparkled with
more than their wonted enthusiasm, and his very air
breathed some exalted purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care, gentlemen,” said the captain one day
to a party of officers near him, “take care! Talbot
is wooing glory that he may win a bride, and if opportunity
offers he may bear away the palm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him if he can,” was the reply, “we will not
begrudge what must be dearly earned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly in a line with the extreme southern limits
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
of two continents, at the confluence of two mighty
oceans, lies Tristan d’Acuna, a high, rocky and uninhabited
island, its summit wrapped in clouds, and,
except in one place, the surf loud and continuous
broke upon its shore. The wind was fresh, and the
tumultuous waves ran high, when through the mist
the Hornet gained a sight of the land. While the
captain hesitated whether to venture in, or lie-to and
await more favorable weather, the cry “sail ho!”
was heard from aloft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where away?” was quickly asked by the officer
of the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broad off the weather beam, sir,” was the reply,
and the Hornet wore round and stood toward the
stranger. None but those who have experienced it
can form an idea of the thrill of delight with which
each man on board of a cruiser, in time of war,
hears the cry “sail ho!” which ensures the excitement
of a chase, and the probability of an engagement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before the hull of the stranger was visible
from the deck, her spars and sails, enveloped in the
mist, in their shadowy outline seemed of gigantic
size. Like a shapeless cloud rather than a thing of
art, she came down before the breeze, now and then
the mist, in fantastic wreaths, half concealing, half
betraying her form and character. The American
hoisted her colors as an invitation to the stranger to
declare her nationality. Shortly after, the report of
a gun came booming over the water, and there was
a shout of exultation among the crew of the Hornet,
as through the vapor they descried the ensign of St.
George. The commander of each vessel, however,
was too good a seaman not to be aware that the wind
was too high, and the sea too rough, for a fair encounter.
Each one, brave himself, doubted not the
valor of his adversary. With a tacit understanding
that they would meet when the gale abated, the ships
hove-to, in each other’s near vicinity. They rode out
the night in safety, each one carrying a light, to denote
her position to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day it moderated, and at 1 P. M. the
Hornet hoisted her jack at the fore, as an intimation
that she was ready for the encounter. The signal
was promptly answered, and the vessels filling away
on opposite tacks, exchanged broadsides as they
passed. Immediately after, like two knights engaged
<span class='it'>à l’outrance</span>, each again wore round and stood directly
for the other, while from forward, aft, successively
as they bore, the guns were fired with singular
precision. As they neared each other, the scene
became more and more exciting: Beside the boom
of the cannon, the pealing of the musketry soon became
incessant, and the hurtling of iron and lead
was terrific. The atmosphere was soon thick and
stifling, and the crews were working their guns with
the energy of desperation, when a severe concussion,
followed by a harsh and grating sound, told that
the ships were afoul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away! boarders away!” was the instant cry on
board of the Englishman, and a host of men, cutlas
and pistol in hand, gathered on his forecastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand by to repel boarders,” was the prompt response
of the American, and a forest of bristling
pikes was arrayed against the assailants. Talk of
serried ranks and wedged battalions; of the compact
square, and even of the deep moat and frowning
parapet! who would not charge upon either,
rather than breast that fretted line of steel, held
by those stern-visaged men! The enemy paused and
faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By word and example, Talbot had encouraged his
men to their utmost exertion, and at the first call,
had hurried with them to repel the enemy; but, when
that enemy hesitated, although but for an instant, he
shouted, “On them, men! on! on!” and rushed
forward as he spoke, to board them in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold, men! hold! Back, Mr. Talbot, back, I
command you,” shouted the captain. “My God!
he’s gone!” he added, as the two ships, lifted high
by a passing wave, fell apart, and the fore-mast of
the enemy came down with a frightful crash. The
instant before, Talbot had sprung upon her bowsprit,
and the next, just escaping the mast as it fell, he was
upon her deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Biddle, although he had been firm as a
veteran throughout the fight, no sooner beheld the
peril of his officer, than, trembling like an aspen, he
sprung into the rigging, and in a voice shrill and distinct
amid the uproar, called out, “Hurt but a hair
of his head and I’ll sink you where you lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, Talbot had not been idle. Striking
right and left, parrying where he could, but not
stopping to return a blow, he pressed on, and in less
time than it has taken to narrate this incident, had
gained the quarter-deck, cut the halliards and hauled
the ensign down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately on separating from the enemy, the
Hornet ranged ahead, and was prepared to throw in
a broadside, but seeing the colors down, hailed to
know if they had surrendered. The reply was in the
affirmative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prize was immediately taken possession of,
and Talbot was found almost insensible, endeavoring
to staunch the blood from an ugly wound with the
flag he had hauled down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So destructive had been the fire of the American
that the prize was completely riddled: She was
therefore scuttled; and in a very short time the Hornet
was again prepared for action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wound of poor Talbot was so severe as to
leave no hope of his being able to perform duty the
remainder of the cruise. A merchant vessel that
was fallen in with was chartered as a cartel, and all
the prisoners, with a few of the wounded, including
Talbot, were put on board of her, to be taken to the
United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the judicious treatment of the medical officer
who accompanied them, he was fast recovering
when they passed the island, where we first introduced
him to the reader. At his urgent request he
was landed, the cartel, after a few hours delay, proceeding
on her course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like the anguish of the parting, the glorious ecstasy
of the meeting of the lovers may be imagined, but
cannot be described.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
“Dear Edward,” said the maiden, as soon as they
were alone, “Dr. Holmes has told me all, and you
have more than realized my wildest and most extravagant
hopes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say not so, Mary! indeed you should rather take
credit to yourself, for if I have been swayed by any
other motive than love of country, it has been to
prove myself worthy of your rare affection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was ever so with you, Edward—you first excite
our admiration, and then ascribe to others the
fruits of your own good deeds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, sweet girl, you wrong yourself and me.
Tell me, what is the body without the soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An inanimate lump of clay—but why the question?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because to me you are what the soul is to the
body—the life which animates and the spirit which
directs it—you are at once my inspiration and my
hope—the burthen of my thoughts, the aim and object
of all my aspirations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Edward, this cannot, nay, I would not
have it to be true; let us change the theme.” She
laid her hand upon his mouth as she spoke—but what
maiden was ever yet displeased with the devotion
of a favored lover?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of their conversation, Talbot learned
that Mr. Gillespie had completed his arrangements,
and was on the look out for a vessel to convey himself
and family to the United States. The former
was of course anxious to accompany them, and in
the midst of happiness was, perhaps, the most impatient
of them all, for Mr. Gillespie would not consent
to his daughter’s marriage before she had seen
her relatives at home: Perhaps, too, he wished to
inquire more particularly than he had yet been enabled
to do, into the character and circumstances of
the man he was about to receive as his son-in-law.
He knew him to be brave and intelligent, and of
frank and winning manners, but he knew nothing
more—the captain of the ship, when he dined with
him, having answered his questions in general terms
of commendation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited for a long time in vain. So ruinous
had the war become to American commerce, that for
months not a vessel from the United States had visited
the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late one evening a schooner, named the Humming-bird,
formerly an American letter-of-marque,
arrived, bringing intelligence of peace between England
and the United States. The owners of the
schooner had without delay applied for a commission
to the Colombian minister, and she was now equipped
as a privateer under that flag. The commander
of her, having been drawn from his course by a vessel
to which he had given chase and captured two
days previous, purposed proceeding immediately to
Nassau, New Providence. As from thence a speedy
conveyance to the United States could certainly be
procured, and no Spanish cruisers were supposed to
be at sea, Mr. Gillespie offered such inducements to
the captain that he consented to take them as passengers,
and gave up his cabin for their accommodation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than sixty hours they sailed, with a light
but favorable wind. About 4 P. M. the second day,
when they were nearly through the Mona passage, it
fell calm. Within the passage, from shore to shore,
there was not a ripple upon the water, and the light
and buoyant little vessel, without advancing a foot,
rose and fell with the mysterious undulation. A few
miles ahead, without the passage, stretching from the
east toward the west, the dark and ruffled surface
was relieved by the white caps of the waves, whose
tops were curling and breaking into sparkling foam.
It was the trade wind sweeping, unobstructed by the
land, toward the Great Bahama Bank. Several vessels
were in sight, among them a large one, coming
down before the wind, but which, less than any, excited
their attention—for she seemed too burthensome
for a Spanish trader to the colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain,” said Talbot, half an hour after, “unless
I am very much mistaken, that large stranger to
windward is a man-of-war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably an Englishman.” replied the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scarcely, the canvas is not sufficiently dark, and
the upper sails roach too much; it is evidently a frigate,
and now I think of it, can hardly be a Frenchman,
for they rarely cruise in this direction. Are
you sure that there are no Spanish cruisers among
the islands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None so large as this,” answered the captain,
“for the Isabella went to leeward upward of a month
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it not have been a ruse?” asked Talbot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the glass,” said the captain, and he looked
long and earnestly; “I cannot make her out,” he
said at length, “but do not like her looks. Get out
the sweeps, Mr. Long,” he added, addressing his
lieutenant, “we must have the Humming-bird out
of this mill-pond, or her wings will be useless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order was promptly obeyed, and the little vessel
was soon moving at the rate of three or four
knots through the water; but the larger vessel was
in the mean time coming down at treble velocity.
As soon as the schooner began to feel the influence
of the wind, the sweeps were laid in, and all sail
made to the northward, in the hope that the stranger
would pass without observing them. In this, however,
they were disappointed, for, as the latter was
brought to bear abeam, they observed with anxiety,
that she edged away toward them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear that we have been deceived in our intelligence,”
said the captain, in reply to a look from
Talbot, as they noticed the suspicious movement of
the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Heaven’s sake, conceal your misgivings
from Mr. Gillespie and his family while there is a
hope,” asked Talbot; to which the captain nodded
assent, and proceeded quietly to make his arrangements
to elude, if possible, the grasp of his pursuer;
for he now felt convinced that he saw the Isabella.
The best sailing of the schooner was by the wind;
instead, therefore, of keeping away before it, she
was hauled close to it, and steered N. N. E. bringing
the frigate to bear forward of the weather beam.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>An humble cottage, overgrown</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With woodbine, stood beside a hill,</p>
<p class='line'>And nigh it, murmuring through moss,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Rippled a little rill.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The hill was high and wore a crown</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Of leafiness, whence, gazing down,</p>
<p class='line'>An eagle might behold the towers</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And turrets of a town.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And many a pleasant country cot,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Snowy, and peering through the green,</p>
<p class='line'>With, now and then, a rivulet,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Meandering, might be seen.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But in the landscape, like a king,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A short half mile or more away,</p>
<p class='line'>A grim old castle stood, erect,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Baronial and gray.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Around it lay an ample park,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With, here and there, a drove of deer;</p>
<p class='line'>A rude old Norman edifice,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dark, desolate and drear!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Perhaps it was the morning sun</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Which made the ancient building smile,</p>
<p class='line'>But, nevertheless, a pleasant look</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Was on the agéd pile.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Perhaps it was with joy it smiled</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That morn, the merriest of the year,</p>
<p class='line'>Which welcomed home its youthful lord,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Young Lionel De Vere.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Perhaps the thought of earlier days</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Flitted athwart its granite brain;</p>
<p class='line'>Perchance it dreamed it might behold</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Those golden hours again—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Those hours when, in the tournament,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Warriors, in glistering steel attired,</p>
<p class='line'>Tilted before young demoiselles,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Who blushed to be admired;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Or when the forest echoes rang</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With many a merry bugle-horn,</p>
<p class='line'>And stag and hounds, a baying rout,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Swept by some autumn morn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But whether it was the morning sun</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>PART I.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>She stood among her garden flowers,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The very loveliest lily there,</p>
<p class='line'>Beauty, bloom, purity and truth</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Unfolding on the air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He paused among the trees and gazed,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And like a bark with sails unfurled,</p>
<p class='line'>His heaving heart went forth to seek</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Another and a fairer world.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>All heaven he felt was in her eye;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Its sunshine glistened in her glance;</p>
<p class='line'>The air he breathed was elfin air;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;His soul was in a trance:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Ah, spirit of some virgin saint,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Turn—turn those blesséd eyes on me,</p>
<p class='line'>And let me kneel and worship thee!”</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Deliriously said he.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>She raised her eyes, her maiden cheek</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Mounting the crimson tinge of dawn,</p>
<p class='line'>And, looking timidly around,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Stood, like a startled fawn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Nay, do not fly,” exclaimed the youth;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Remain; allow my thirsty eyes</p>
<p class='line'>To quaff thy beauty: I would drain</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A draught of Paradise.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Wonder awaking in her face,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The maiden stood, with lips apart,</p>
<p class='line'>Drinking his voice, whose cadence stole</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In harmony to her heart.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And even as she stood he came,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And, kneeling, bade her fear no wrong;</p>
<p class='line'>While all the while the murmuring air</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Moved musical with song.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>His words were not as other’s words,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;His voice was like no other voice,</p>
<p class='line'>Somehow, she knew not why, it made</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Her maiden heart rejoice.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And from that moment all things grew</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Lovelier with light, because of him,</p>
<p class='line'>And, like a cup of wine, her heart</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Was crimson to the brim.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“What shall I call thee?” asked the maid;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“How name thee?” “Clarence is my name,”</p>
<p class='line'>Returned the youth—“an honest one,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Though all unknown to fame.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“And how shall I call thee?” quoth he.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“Florence,” replied the maid—“a mean</p>
<p class='line'>And humble village girl.” “But fit,”</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Said he, “to be a queen!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Day after day, at eventide,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The stranger sought her, breathing words</p>
<p class='line'>Of passion, while her timid heart</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Beat like a frightened bird’s.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But not with fear, for every pulse</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Was swayed by love, that, moon-like, rides</p>
<p class='line'>The empyrean of the adoring heart</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And rules its purple tides.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Merrily through the town they went</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A proud, chivalric cavalcade</p>
<p class='line'>Of knights and nobles and esquires,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In silken robes arrayed.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span></p>
<p class='line'>And each sustained his high degree,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But foremost there, without a peer</p>
<p class='line'>In manly majesty of mien,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Rode Lionel De Vere.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The ostrich plumes which flowed and waved</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In silver clouds above his brow,</p>
<p class='line'>Were gray and lustreless beside</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That forehead’s dazzling snow.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The diamond broach which held the plume</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Flashed in the sunlight, like a star,</p>
<p class='line'>Throwing its ever radiant rays</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In rainbow hues afar.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The ruby burning on his breast,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Blazing and blossoming as he turned,</p>
<p class='line'>Was fervid as his heart, which, fed</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With honor, nobly burned.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And as he passed, his lofty head</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Bending in answer to the cries</p>
<p class='line'>Of loving vassals, nobler form</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Never met woman’s eyes.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A smile for one of mean degree,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A courteous bow for one of high,</p>
<p class='line'>So modulated both that each</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Saw friendship in his eye.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Onward he rode, while like the sound</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Of surf along a shingly shore,</p>
<p class='line'>The murmur of a people’s joy</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Marched, herald-like, before.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Timidly, while before them pressed</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The peasants, in a little nook</p>
<p class='line'>Two women stood—two timid things—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To snatch a hasty look:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>One, weak and old—an agéd dame—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;December toward its latter day;</p>
<p class='line'>The other young and pure and fair,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The maiden month of May:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Trembling with curious delight</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;She rose on tip-toe, gazing through</p>
<p class='line'>The mass of heads which, like a hedge,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Bordered the avenue.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The sound of horns, which rolled and broke</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Like summer thunder, and the crash</p>
<p class='line'>Of cymbals, while the hound-like drum</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Howled underneath the lash;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The toss of plumes, the neigh of steeds,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The silken murmur of attire,</p>
<p class='line'>As the proud cavalcade drew nigh,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Filled her young heart with fire.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He came, her lord, the lord of all</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Who gazed and gazed afar or near,</p>
<p class='line'>And as he bowed they hailed with shouts</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Lord Lionel De Vere.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A trouble flitted through her face—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A shadow, and before her eyes</p>
<p class='line'>She passed her hands, as if to check</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Some terrible surmise.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Nearer and nearer, while like one</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Struck dumb she gazed, the noble came,</p>
<p class='line'>And as he passed the people flung</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their blessings on his name.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>One little cry—a feeble cry—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The name of “Clarence,” and she passed:</p>
<p class='line'>He heard it not, its tiny sound</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Died in the clarion’s blast.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>PART III.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The cottage stood in solitude,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The woodbine rustled on the wall,</p>
<p class='line'>The Marguerites in the garden waved</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In murmurs one and all;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And, rippling by, the rivulet</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed sobbing, like a frightened child,</p>
<p class='line'>Who, wandering on, has lost its way</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In some deserted wild.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The day was waning in the west,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And slowly, like a dainty dream,</p>
<p class='line'>The delicate twilight dropped her veil</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On fallow, field and stream.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The purple sky was sown with stars</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;When Clarence came: she was not there,</p>
<p class='line'>And desolately frowned the night,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And stagnant was the air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But on the little rustic seat</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Where they had often sat, there shone</p>
<p class='line'>A letter, and the noble name</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Along it was his own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Farewell,” it said, “that I exist</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Breathing the word which is the knell</p>
<p class='line'>Of love and hope is not my will.</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But God’s alone: Farewell.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Never more on this once loved spot,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Never more on the rivulet’s bank,</p>
<p class='line'>Shall we sojourn: my love, great lord,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Insults thy lofty rank.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Go, seek some fitter mate: for me,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Too poor to be thy wife, too proud</p>
<p class='line'>To be thy leman, grief, despair,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The death-bed, and the shroud.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He read appalled, amazed, aghast,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Stern as a statue, and the stone</p>
<p class='line'>Was pale Despair, its haggard look</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Less awful than his own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A thought, and like a storm he dashed</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Along the grassy walk: no spark</p>
<p class='line'>Shone from the cottage: all within,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Without, around, was dark.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He knocked and knocked, but no one came:</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He entered, and the silent room</p>
<p class='line'>Was vacant, and his darkened heart</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Grew darker with the gloom.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Next day the grim old castle stood</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Neglected: whether its heart of stone</p>
<p class='line'>Was touched, I know not, yet I heard</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The ancient mansion moan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Perhaps I was deceived; the wind</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Went howling over woods and moors,</p>
<p class='line'>And round the castle, like a ghost</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Stalking its corridors.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>PART IV.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The snow had fallen hour on hour;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The wind was keen, and loud and shrill</p>
<p class='line'>It whistled through the naked trees</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And round the frozen hill.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span></p>
<p class='line'>The country everywhere was white;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The forest oaks that moaned and pined</p>
<p class='line'>Wore caps of snow, which, bowing low,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They doffed before the wind.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Twilight descended, and the air</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Was gray, and like a sense of dread,</p>
<p class='line'>Night on the virgin breast of earth</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Her sable shadows spread.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Slowly, with wavering steps a man</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Moved on a solitary moor,</p>
<p class='line'>With staff, and shell, and sandaled shoon,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A pilgrim pale and poor.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Slowly, with trembling steps he moved,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Pausing, as if uncertain where</p>
<p class='line'>To take his way, when, faint and far,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A bell disturbed the air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And as with concentrated strength</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He sought the sound, a little light</p>
<p class='line'><a id='Shone'></a>Shone flickeringly and glow-worm like</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through the ravine of night.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>A little light that with each step</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Became distinct, until his eyes</p>
<p class='line'>Beheld a convent’s welcome walls</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Between him and the skies.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He reached the portal—rang the bell,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And as above him rose the moon,</p>
<p class='line'>Sank, like the storm: the portress found</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The pilgrim in a swoon.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>They bore the wasted wanderer in:</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Pallid but beautiful he lay,</p>
<p class='line'>A dream which seemed to come from heaven</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Though clad in suffering clay.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And when, long hours of anguish gone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;His eyes once more shone calmly blue,</p>
<p class='line'>Looks that seemed grievous memories</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dimmed their ethereal hue.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>His soul, which many days had walked</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The ploughshares of consuming love.</p>
<p class='line'>Wrung by the ordeal, raised its eyes</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Toward Him Who reigned above.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He sought the chapel; at the shrine</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Knelt, while his eyes were wet with tears—</p>
<p class='line'>God’s love in holy harmonies</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Filling his penitent ears.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Even as he knelt the solemn mass,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;“<span class='sc'>Ora pro nobis, domine</span>,”</p>
<p class='line'>Rose, like a dove on sun-lit wings,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Seeking the heavenly way.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Concordant voices sweet and clear</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Rang through the consecrated nave,</p>
<p class='line'>Discoursing melodies which rolled</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And broke, wave over wave.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>As in an ecstasy he knelt,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Cheeks, lips and eyes alive with light,</p>
<p class='line'>Radiant, as if a saint, or Christ</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Himself had blessed his sight.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>For in the voices one sweet voice</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Swam, like a spirit’s, in his ears:</p>
<p class='line'>He could not speak, or move, or breathe;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While slowly trickling tears</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Ran down his cheeks, as, louder still,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The swan-voiced organ breathed its knell,</p>
<p class='line'>And on its cloudy height of song</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Paused, trembled, moaned and fell.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But as its echoes died away,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;His spirit trod that golden shore</p>
<p class='line'>Where hope becomes reality</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And sorrow is no more.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He sought the abbess; on his knees</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Unfolded, page by page, his grief;</p>
<p class='line'>While she, albeit cold and stern,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Wept, yielding to belief.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And Florence came, while Clarence stood</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In breathless silence far apart,</p>
<p class='line'>A thousand hopes and joys and fears</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Conflicting at his heart.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Throwing aside his pilgrim cowl</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Clarence fell trembling at her feet:</p>
<p class='line'>“Florence,” he murmured, “loved and lost,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;At last, at last we meet.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>She stood in silence, with her eyes</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Fixed on the youth—a heavenly calm</p>
<p class='line'>From out whose subsidence of sound</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Came “Clarence,” like a psalm.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And then he knelt and told his tale:</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;How he had loved in other lands,</p>
<p class='line'>And she he sought had faithlessly</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Obeyed a sire’s commands,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And left him desolate; how, when,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;After long weeks of aching pain</p>
<p class='line'>A pale, heartbroken, weary man,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With fevered brow and brain,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He sought his native land, and stood</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Again within his castle halls,</p>
<p class='line'>But found that soothing Peace had flown</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Forever from its walls;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And how, when wandering in the woods,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Accusing God of all his wo,</p>
<p class='line'>Madder with memories of the Past</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Than any fiend below,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>She, Florence, like an angel, rose</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To calm his heart, and dry his tears,</p>
<p class='line'>And fill his brain with melodies</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Stolen from statelier spheres.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And how he sought to test her love,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And feared, recurring to the past,</p>
<p class='line'>That this, his eidolon of joy,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Might prove too bright to last.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And so, in humble garb, in state</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;No loftier than the maiden’s own,</p>
<p class='line'>He sought her love, not for his lands</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But for himself alone.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And how he came and found her gone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And since, month after month, in pain,</p>
<p class='line'>Had followed her from town to town,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With burning heart and brain;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And how, when hope was gone, and life</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed like a land which lay behind—</p>
<p class='line'>The future like a desolate void—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;How, when he most repined—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>
<p class='line'>When death had been a welcome thing,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Her voice, the concord of the spheres,</p>
<p class='line'>Had called his memory from her tomb</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On which it lay in tears.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>She stood and listened with her eyes</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And ears and heart—cheek, lip and brow</p>
<p class='line'>Serene with happiness which shone,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like sunlight over snow.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And with a breathless eloquence</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Which, more than words or vows, exprest</p>
<p class='line'>Her boundless confidence, she hid</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Her blushes in his breast.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>One day, in early autumn time,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In spirit, I traversed the plain,</p>
<p class='line'>And sought De Vere’s ancestral towers,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And gazed on them again.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>They stood in green and glorious age;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The rooks wheeled round the ancient walls,</p>
<p class='line'>And peals of mirthful merriment</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Peopled the castle halls—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Loud laughs, which made the watchful deer,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With ears thrown forward, look and bleat</p>
<p class='line'>And seek a covert, while the sounds</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Followed their pattering feet.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>The swallows, twittering in the air,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed sharers in the general gladness;</p>
<p class='line'>The stares from oak and beach and elm,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chattered in merry madness.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Across the drawbridge, as I gazed,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A merry, laughing cavalcade,</p>
<p class='line'>With dogs in leash and hawk on hand,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dashed madly down the glade.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Among them, stateliest of them all,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Sat one whose broad and ample brow,</p>
<p class='line'>Though white with time, was full of life</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As lichen under snow.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And by his side, with smiling eye,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And swelling breast, in robes of green,</p>
<p class='line'>Rode one, round whom the nobles prest</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As round a loving queen.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And after, hand on hip, two youths</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Rode gayly onward, side by side,</p>
<p class='line'>Returning with admiring love</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their parents’ glance of pride.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>While in the distance, like a sire</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Who sees at Christmas festival</p>
<p class='line'>His happy children laughing round,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Smiled the baronial hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, are you determined, then, to marry
Annette to Mr. Eccleson?” asked Mr. Goodman of
his sister, Mrs. Doily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I am, brother,” answered the lady.
“In every respect it is a most advantageous match
for her; indeed, John, I assure you that I look upon
an alliance with the Eccleson family as one of the
most desirable things which could possibly happen,
and so does Mr. Doily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not agree with you,” said her brother;
“and I fear in the end, you may have reason to
change your present views.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why so, brother?” returned Mrs. Doily. “It
seems to me you are always looking upon the dark
side! Now do tell me, John, what reasonable objection
you can possibly have to Annette’s marriage—I
am sure I see none—and, of course, no one can have
her happiness more at heart than her own mother!
Is not Mr. Eccleson very rich, and nearly allied to
some of the very first families in the city? His age
surely can be no serious objection—indeed, it is all
for the best, for a man stands still, while a woman
grows old; and fifteen years hence, depend upon it,
no one will think him fifteen years her senior. Then
he is very agreeable, and certainly uncommonly
good-looking!” and with the air of one who feels
satisfied that they have the best of the argument,
Mrs. Doily complacently swung to and fro in her
easy rocking-chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Jane, he is all these—and, you may add,
too, as proud as Lucifer!” said Mr. Goodman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has reason to be proud!” put in Mrs. Doily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he has,” answered her brother, “and
you will find that his pride will not allow him to acknowledge
willingly any connection with a dry-goods
retailer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ridiculous, brother—how foolish you talk!
Pray, then, why should he offer to marry Annette,
if he looks upon the connection as something to be
ashamed of?” said Mrs. Doily, getting almost angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? why because he has fallen in love with
Annette’s pretty face; he means to marry <span class='it'>her</span>, not
her family, and he trusts to his future power over
her, and to a woman’s devotedness to her husband,
right or wrong, to wean her away from all her earlier
ties!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John, you really talk very strangely!” exclaimed
Mrs. Doily, almost ready to cry. “What possesses
you to run on in this way, just as if my dear Annette
could ever be brought to give up all her old friends
for strangers. I do wish you would not talk so—it
really makes me nervous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear sister, I may be mistaken, and
for your sake, and for Annette’s sake, I hope to God
I am! I call myself a pretty good judge of character,
and if I err not, Mr. Eccleson has so much pride,
arrogance, perhaps, would be the better word, for it
is not the pride of a high-minded, honorable man, as
will make him callous what ties he rends, or what
sacred altars he may trample down to serve his own
ambitious views. Besides, Jane, I never yet knew
any true happiness to result from unequal marriages;
and I tell you honestly, that were Annette my
daughter, I would sooner see her the wife of an
honest young tradesman, who has his own fortune
and standing to build up, than the wife of Penn
Eccleson, were he ten times richer than he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, John, were Annette <span class='it'>your daughter</span>!”
said Mrs. Doily, forcing a laugh. “Yes, I know,
old bachelors and old maids are always most wonderful
patterns of parental prudence! but with all your
prejudices you will allow one thing, I hope, that
Mr. Eccleson is far from being either a selfish or a
mercenary man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I deny the first,” interrupted Mr. Goodman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For he refuses to receive any fortune with Annette;
true, we could not give her much—five or
six thousand dollars, perhaps—but even that is something;
and I am sure his refusal to accept of it is
very noble. It is Annette, and Annette alone he
wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, very true—it is Annette he wants, and not
a penny of the retailer’s money—there shall be no
obligation of that nature to bind him to the family of
the future Mrs. Eccleson!” exclaimed Mr. Goodman,
starting up angrily from his chair. “Jane, Jane, I
protest against this marriage!” and seizing his hat
and cane, he withdrew, leaving poor Mrs. Doily
bathed in the tears she was no longer able to restrain—tears
of vexation and anger, at what she deemed
the willful obstinacy of her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If what Uncle John said was true, it was certainly
yet to be proved, for, perhaps, no marriage in the
eyes of partial, hopeful parents, ever promised a
fairer prospect of happiness to trusting girlhood than
that so soon to be consummated.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>Penn Eccleson belonged exclusively to the monied
aristocracy. His grandfather and father before him,
had both commenced life with a determination to be
rich—richer—richest—and what the former had accumulated
from small beginnings and careful savings,
were as carefully and judiciously applied by the son,
until little by little the broad foundation of future
wealth was successfully established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days of their youth, when the freshness of
their young lives should have been given to better
and holier ends, the parents of Penn Eccleson looked
forward only to the aggrandizement of themselves
and children, through the potent influence of money;
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
and to this end they toiled and delved in the service
of Mammon, with a bondage almost equal to that of
the gold-seeking maniac amid the mountain fastnesses
of California, denying themselves all the
luxuries, and most of the comforts of life to swell
the hoard of avarice, and feed their ill-directed ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As years took their flight, step by step the Ecclesons
gradually emerged from the obscurity of a
narrow cross-street in the lower part of the city, to
the possession of one of the most elegant establishments
in the fashionable region of —— Square.
The most <span class='it'>genteel</span> schools were selected for their
children, who were expressly forbidden to form any
friendships with their little school-mates, save those
whose parents could at least boast of a carriage, and
thus, their heads early filled with conceit and pride,
the little Ecclesons formed as disagreeable a trio as
one would care to see—for assuredly there is nothing
more unpleasing, than to behold the beautiful
simplicity of childhood lost in the supercilious airs
and artificial graces of the fine lady!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ecclesons were regarded at first in no very
favorable light, in the quarter they had chosen for
their debut into high life, and occasionally their
pride suffered severely. But with a pertinacity
worthy a higher aim, they firmly stood their ground,
and upon the strength of their fine dinners, and their
splendid parties, were, in the course of a few years,
not only tolerated, but received with favor into those
circles they most coveted. Their only son, meanwhile,
was traveling in Europe, with a <span class='it'>carte-blanche</span>
in his pocket for any expenses he might choose to
indulge, and the sage advice of worthy Polonius
engrafted on his mind, in the sense, I mean, with
which Mr. Hudson translates Shakspeare, that is,
“to sit up all night to make himself a gentleman,
and take no pains to make himself a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time rolled on. Their daughters made highly
eligible matches, their son returned elegant in person,
polished in manners, and then it was time for
the old people to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubtless it would have been a satisfaction to them
to have witnessed their own sumptuous funerals;
to have known how daintily their rigid limbs were
draped in the finest of linen, and upon what soft,
downy cushions within their narrow bed their heads
were pillowed. It would have been a splendid
pageant for their pride—the richly emblazoned coffin—the
pall of velvet sweeping to the ground—the
hearse, with its long shadowy plumes—the high-mettled
horses curbed to a solemn pace, yet tossing
their heads and manes as if nobly spurning from
them the trappings of fictitious wo in which they
were forced to act a part—the stately equipages
which follow their dust to the “City of the Dead”—and
then their own epitaphs; it would have amazed
them to have known how many virtues of which
they themselves were ignorant, that finely chiseled
marble bestowed upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman remembered each of his daughters
and their families handsomely in his will, and
then bequeathed to his son the residue of his large
property, including the fine mansion in —— Square.
Penn Eccleson might therefore be considered by
speculating papas and mammas a most eligible
match. Nature had also been most lavish in her
personal gifts, while Fortune, as we have seen, had
already secured him her favors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But young Eccleson seemed in no hurry to take a
wife, and he had nearly attained his thirtieth year
ere he began seriously to look about him. At this
time he accidentally saw Annette Doily at the Opera,
and became instantly a victim to love at first sight.
It must be owned his ardor was somewhat cooled,
upon ascertaining that this beautiful young creature
was—nobody! that is, she was only the daughter of
a mere shopkeeper, who dealt out tapes and bobbins,
and sold cambric by the yard. This fact, for a time,
was sufficient to keep his ardor in check, but upon
being thrown again into her presence, it broke forth
with renewed violence. He gave himself no rest
until he had found a way to make her acquaintance,
and thus led by the little god, the haughty Penn
Eccleson, who walked the earth as though he were
lord of all, became a frequent visiter at the house of
Mr. Doily, and a suitor for the hand of his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annette was, indeed, a lovely young creature,
whose seventeenth summer had scarcely dawned
over her innocent, happy life. I would fain describe
her, as her image comes up before me in the
dream of the past, but my pen is unable to trace the
indescribable charm which dwelt upon her countenance,
or the artless grace which pervaded all her
movements. And these were the least traits which
endeared her to her friends, for never was there a
heart more affectionate and confiding, or a disposition
so guileless. What wonder that the polished manners
and insinuating address of Eccleson should have
gained her heart, and that with all the fervor and
truthfulness of a first love, she blushingly consented
to be his—grateful, too, for the preference he had
yielded a simple child like herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Doily were proud of their daughter,
and proud of the conquest she had achieved. In the
alliance they saw an immense advantage; it not
only placed their beloved Annette at once in the
highest circles of rank and fashion, but to Mr. Doily,
the benefit to his business, arising from a connection
with the Eccleson family, would be incalculable.
He already fancied himself turning his back upon
the counter, and established among the bales and
boxes of a large wholesale house—perhaps an importer—a
ship-owner; while Mrs. Doily, with the true
instinct of a mother, forgetting all self, rejoiced that
her two younger daughters would be ushered into
society under the patronage of their wealthy brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle John was the only one who predicted aught
but undivided happiness from the union.</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>Had the cloudless heaven which dawned upon
their wedding morn, and the bright sun which burst
in gladness over them, but typified their future lot,
how blest and happy would it have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eccleson preferred to be married in church, and
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
a gay retinue attended the bridal pair to the sacred
edifice wherein their solemn vows were to be registered.
As side by side they stood in the holy chancel,
all eyes turned admiringly upon them—she so charming,
yet so unconscious of her loveliness, as with
her little hand nestled in his she received the holy
benediction of the priest, while as he bent his lips to
her pure brow, a softness rested upon the features
of the bridegroom, which rendered his beauty almost
godlike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceremony over, the two sisters of Eccleson,
proud, haughty dames, advanced and coldly saluted
the pale cheek of the fair bride, and honored the
sadly happy mother with a stately bow. Eccleson
touched his lips to the proffered cheek of Mrs. Doily,
and then receiving the weeping Annette from the
arms of her parents, bore her exultingly to the carriage,
as if eager to point the barrier henceforth to
be raised between <span class='it'>her</span> and <span class='it'>them</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new married pair were absent two or three
months on a bridal tour, and then returned to the city—their
house in the interim having been newly and
magnificently furnished to the tune of thousands, under
the supervision of Mrs. Dash and Townlif, the sisters
of Eccleson. But Annette pined to embrace her mother;
not all the <a id='gild'></a>gilded baubles which on every side
met her eye, not all the splendors of which her husband
proudly proclaimed her the mistress, could for
a moment quell the yearnings of her affectionate
heart; and scarcely bestowing a glance upon the
magnificence which surrounded her, she begged the
carriage might take her to her parents and sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Annette! she was now to receive her first
lesson from her haughty lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Annette, you must not think of it,” replied
Eccleson, carelessly loosing the arms twined so
fondly round his neck, “you are very tired, love,
and I cannot consent to your further fatiguing yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, dear Penn, you are mistaken, I am not
in the least tired; O, pray let me go home, if only
for an hour!” said Annette, with her little hand upon
his shoulder, and her large, dark eyes bent beseechingly
upon his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Annette, I cannot suffer you to go into
P—— Street to-night; beside, love,” he added, “it
pains me to hear you speak of going <span class='it'>home</span>, as if this
were not your home, your <span class='it'>only</span> home, Annette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a meaning stress upon the word “only,”
which, however, Annette did not observe, so crushed
was she by the disappointment his refusal caused
her. She hesitated a moment, and then once more
flinging her arms around him, she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest husband, I must go—do not refuse me.
Only think, it is three months since I have seen them—three
months, Penn, since I have embraced my
mother. I know they are pining to behold me once
more, for I was never away from them even for
a day until I became yours, dear Penn; I am sure
I shall not sleep unless I see them to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Annette,” replied Eccleson; “you are
no longer a child, I hope, to be thus sighing and
whining after your mother; really I am quite ashamed
of my little wife! Come, I will myself show you to
your dressing-room; you have not yet seen the
splendid diamonds I have for you, nor the elegant
<span class='it'>trousseau</span> my sisters have prepared. Come, Annette,”
and encircling her slender waist with his
arm, he would have led her from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears stood in Annette’s beautiful eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest Penn, will you do me a favor? If you
object to my going home to-night, then let the carriage
drive round into P—— Street, and bring my mother
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eccleson drew himself up haughtily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absurd, Annette—I shall certainly do no such
thing. In the morning I shall not object to your
visiting your parents, provided you take an early
hour ere we may expect <span class='it'>my</span> friends to call upon
you; but the truth is, the less frequent you make
your visits in P—— Street, Annette, the better I shall
be pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” exclaimed Annette, with
a startled look upon the countenance of her husband;
“indeed I do not understand you, dear Penn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear girl. I will endeavor to explain
myself more clearly,” answered Eccleson. “You
are, of course, aware that by your marriage with me,
your position in life has wholly changed; you are
now raised to a sphere greatly above that from
which I took you; and as my wife will henceforth
move in none but the highest and most distinguished
circles of the city; and therefore, dearest Annette,
for my sake as well as for your own, it will be desirable
that you forget all old associations as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not understand you even now, I think,”
said Annette, smiling sadly. “No, I am sure, dear
Penn, I do not take your true meaning—for it cannot
be you would have me sacrifice my parents to my
new position, to renounce all the fond ties of home!
that is not what you mean?” she added with an
appealing look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a certain sense that <span class='it'>is</span> my meaning, love,”
answered her husband. “I shall offer no objections
to your visiting your excellent parents occasionally,
or as your parents of receiving them into my house;
but, my sweet Annette, you must study to control
your wishes for a very frequent repetition of these
family meetings. It may seem impossible to you
now, but believe me, dearest, you will soon find so
much that is novel and delightful to occupy your
thoughts, that you will cease to regret that which
appears to afflict you so much at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With her little hands clasped upon her bosom, and
her eyes gazing almost wildly into his, did Annette
listen to the words of her heartless, selfish husband.
But there was no resentment, no anger visible in her
sweet face; with a sigh which would have moved
any heart but his, she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am grieved to hear you speak so, dear Penn;
nothing can ever make me forgetful of the ties of
nature; you yourself would despise me, if, through
the allurements of wealth and fashion, I could be
brought to forget those who gave me being. You
know you would; say so, dearest Penn—you only
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
wanted to prove me, did you?” and casting one arm
fondly around his neck, with a sadly sweet smile
she bent her lovely eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annette, we will not talk of this more at present,”
answered her husband; “enough that if you
love me, you will, by and bye, better understand and
<span class='it'>do</span> my meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first night Annette passed under her husband’s
roof was a sleepless one. Her chamber, in its luxurious
adornments, might have received a princess—but
little did she heed it. The beautiful hangings of
pink and silver which swept around the bed—the
rich counterpane of white satin which enveloped
her lovely form—the downy pillows cased in the
finest lace—nor all the splendors which surrounded
her, had power for a moment to divert her saddened
thoughts, or stay the tears of wounded affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But hope, bright hope is ever the blessing of youth
as of age, and with the morning dawn gladdened the
heart of the young wife with its peaceful influence,
and whispered that her husband meant not the cruel
words he had spoken, and that all would yet be well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an early hour the carriage was at the door, and
Annette was borne once more to the arms of her
parents. She hoped, but dared not ask her husband
to accompany her, and it was with a heavy sigh and
a starting tear that, after handing her into the carriage,
she saw him once more ascend the marble steps, and
then, as the carriage drove off, kissing his hand to
her, re-enter the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fond welcome of home Annette lost the
sorrow which already touched her young heart. As
she viewed each dear familiar spot, her marriage
seemed but a dream. From room to room she flew
with the gladness of a bird—the kitchen—the nursery—the
dear old school-room, all felt her light footstep
now rapidly sweeping the keys of the piano as she
glided past—now chasing the little kitten from
“mother’s” work-basket—now releasing her pet
canary from its wiry prison, to perch upon her
finger—and finally seating herself upon a low cushion
at the feet of her mother, with the shaggy, sleepy
head of old Rover in her lap, she prepared to answer
some of the many questions poured upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what a proud, happy mother was Mrs. Doily
at that moment—laughing and crying at the same
moment as she looked upon her dear, darling Annette.
How many affectionate inquiries she had to
make about her new son-in-law—what plans she
laid for the future—why did not Mr. Eccleson come
with her? But she knew he would soon—and Annette
must stay to dinner; yes, the carriage must go
back without her, she had been away from them so
long they could not spare her to-day; and Mr.
Eccleson would come to dinner—it was lucky, for
they were going to have boiled turkey and oysters,
and the nicest, fattest pair of ducks she ever saw.
But Annette reluctantly excused herself—they were
to receive their wedding visits, and she must go—some
other day, soon, very soon she would come.
And kissing them all a dozen times, she sprung into
the carriage and returned home with a lightened
heart—for it could not be that her husband would
willingly deprive her of so much enjoyment as that
one brief hour had given her.</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'>It is needless to trace, day by day, and hour by
hour, the thralls which gradually tightened around
the kind, loving heart of Annette, who passively
yielded herself to the selfish demands of her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the haughty relatives of Eccleson she was received
either with formal courtesy, or with that condescending
air of patronage, the most keenly cutting
to a sensitive soul. She would have loved them,
poor girl, if they would have suffered her love; but
her advances were always chillingly repelled—they
wished her to feel the vast difference which existed
between a shopkeeper’s daughter and their “almighty
dreadful little mightinesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eccleson loved his young wife as dearly as it was
in his nature to love any one, save <span class='it'>self</span>—and all <span class='it'>but</span>
his pride, would have sacrificed to her happiness.
To a gay round of parties, <span class='it'>soirées</span>, the opera, theatres,
and concerts, he bore her night after night, until any
less gentle nature than Annette’s would have been
lost in the giddy whirl of fashion. Her dresses, her
jewels, her equipage, out-rivaled all others; she
was the belle of the brilliant circle in which she
moved; but she pined in her gilded prison, and
longed to lay her aching head upon her mother’s
bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very fact that her husband looked upon her
relatives as inferior to himself, marked the galling
dependence of her situation. She was his wife, but
fettered by bonds which ate into her soul. Almost
wholly was she now debarred from the society of
her own friends—for she could not see them insulted,
and no better than insult was the haughty bearing
which Eccleson assumed toward them, and therefore
she preferred they should think her the heartless
thing she seemed, than by persisting in her claims,
subject them and herself to renewed contumely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Better would it have been for Annette had she
possessed more firmness of character—a <span class='it'>will</span> to do as
she pleased—a determination to have her rights respected.
But she was by nature too gentle to wrestle
with the unfeeling hearts around her, and therefore
yielded herself a passive victim. Or better, perhaps,
would it have been, had her bosom covered a
marble heart, and that, callous to all the tender ties
which can make life desirable, she should have
walked through life that mysterious anomaly—a
beautiful woman without a soul!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The step of Annette gradually lost its light elastic
tread—her cheek grew pale—her eyes no longer reflected
the innocent gayety of a happy heart, but
bent low their drooping lids as if to hide their weight
of sorrow—the bright smile which lent its charms to
her speaking countenance faded sadly away. In less
than two years after her marriage with that proud,
haughty man, poor Annette was dying—dying of a
broken-heart—of crushed and blighted affection!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too late to save her did Eccleson see his error.
He saw that he had drawn too strongly upon her
gentle, pliant nature, and that barred from the light
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
and sun of her childhood’s home—shut out from the
kindly sympathies of parental love, like some beautiful
flower of the forest torn from its genial bed, she
was to fade and die at ambition’s altar!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To restore her, if possible, and bitterly repenting
his cruelty, Eccleson now did all in the power of
mortal to stay her angel flight. He brought her
parents around her—he surrounded her bedside with
the most skillful physicians, and lavished upon her
all the comforts which wealth could purchase. He
took her home and restored to her the treasured
associations of her early life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Annette was grateful—deeply grateful for
this too long deferred kindness; and now that in this
reunion life seemed again to present so many charms,
she would have desired to live had her Heavenly
Father so willed it. But it was too late. The
barbed arrow had penetrated too deeply her innocent
bosom to be withdrawn. With her hand
clasped in that of her repentant husband, and her
head pillowed on her mother’s breast, her gentle
spirit took its flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentle reader, this is no exaggerated story I have
given you. It is but another life-drawn sketch of the
evils which too frequently arise from unequal marriages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” cried I, falling at her feet, “a
simple mortal, who loses his senses before your
beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up! doctor, get up,” said the <span class='it'>danseuse</span>, with
a countenance of severity suddenly assumed—“no
nonsense before your god-daughter! You forget
yourself—she will tell a thousand stories when we
get home. Have you never seen the ‘Terrible
Children of Gavarni?’ They are all spies, these
little innocents!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I got up from my knees in confusion, and excused
myself as well as I could. Her anger seemed to cool.
She gave me her hand, and drawing a deep sigh, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had all these beautiful things in my drawing-room,
I should consider myself richer than the Sultana
Valida.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This evening, Mademoiselle, my Chinese parlor
shall be transferred to your hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, doctor, I will go and prepare for it.
I hope you are in earnest, for the fun of the thing,
even if it were only to shame the Parisians by your
generosity. By the bye, wouldn’t you like to sketch
my left foot also? What will you do with one foot
without the other—don’t be modest—have the match
to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, I dared not ask you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
“Ah! I am always generous—I don’t do things
by halves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kindliness and grace! Mademoiselle, it
is not this miserable collection I should offer you.
I would I could place at your feet the pagoda of the
suburb Vai lo ching, which is of porcelain, with tiles
of massive gold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would suit me exactly, <span class='it'>particularly the
tiles</span>!—Is my foot placed right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My design is completed, Mademoiselle; my
gratitude for your kindness will never end—may I
call to-morrow to visit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow—dear doctor, to-morrow is an unlucky
day! I dance to-morrow, and must practice
for five hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day after, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day after? that’s Saturday—I always dine
with my mother on Saturday—Sunday I shall be free
as air. Suppose I take you to Versailles on Sunday?
we can eat a hare at a country inn, and drink milk.
You will accept my invitation will you not?—agreed
then. Oh! how delighted I shall be to get into the
fields and inhale the fragrance of the flowers. Sunday,
then, dear doctor, my carriage shall be at your
door at twelve o’clock; I am as exact as a Breguet
watch—adieu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no women in China—it is the only thing
our ancestors forgot to invent! If Mademoiselle
Alexandrine were to appear at Pekin she would take
the empire by storm! You can form no idea of that
divine creature—graceful as a bird—speaking as melodiously
as she sings—springing as she walks—doing
a thousand delicious things in a moment, and
throwing at you sweet and flashing glances, like the
twinkling of a star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In quitting my parlor, she left a void which made
me nervous. It was necessary to do something not
to fall a prey to melancholy. I hurried my servants
to the four corners of the street for porters, and in
about an hour my room was cleared—before dinner
my beautiful <span class='it'>danseuse</span> had received every thing.
What a sweet night I had! I had the copy of
each foot in either hand! and I said to myself, at
this moment she is blessing me—she praises my
generosity before the altar of Tien—in her eyes a
single man exists! and that is me!—for her the rest
of the world has disappeared!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With what impatience was Sunday expected—that
Sunday which promised me such happiness! I
wanted to break all the clocks about me, because
they seemed joined in a conspiracy against me, to
lengthen out Saturday! Notwithstanding my impatience
the hours rolled round, and on Sunday, an age
after the clock struck eleven, it announced mid-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood in my balcony and devoured every carriage
with my eyes. At six o’clock I had seen all the carriages
in Paris roll by—and I was still alone! Alone!
when one has been promised a <span class='it'>rendezvous</span>! There
is in this deception the very delirium of despair!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as it was proper I ran to visit Mademoiselle
de St. Phar. The porter, hardly concealing a
smile, said, “Mademoiselle de Saint Phar has gone
to the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will she return?” asked I, with deathlike
visage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After Easter or Christmas,” answered the porter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I came away I heard loud laughter in chorus
from the whole family of porters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No news of Mademoiselle de Saint Phar! Every
night at the opera—but no <span class='it'>danseuse</span>. Her name no
longer appeared in the bills—it had disappeared from
the ballet as her person had from her hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could I abase my dignity as representative of the
Celestial Empire by causing search to be made for
a <span class='it'>danseuse</span>? What would the grand secretary for
foreign affairs have said of me! I could only suffer
in silence. So I did suffer—and hold my tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forty days after that fatal Sunday I was walking
along a great street, whose name I forget, and having
a habit of reading signs as I pass along, what was
my astonishment to read the following:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.1em;font-weight:bold;'>“CITY OF PEKIN!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.1em;font-weight:bold;'>Chinese Curiosities at fix’d prices.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In taking a glance at the window, I recognized
some of those I had formerly owned. So I stepped
into the shop, resolved to repurchase them if the
price were not too high. An involuntary exclamation
escaped me! the shopkeeper was a young woman—in
short, Mademoiselle Alexandrine de Saint
Phar!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was thunderstruck, and as immovable as one of
my clay compatriots at my side: but the <span class='it'>danseuse</span>
smiled charmingly, and without interrupting her embroidery
work, she said with a <span class='it'>sang froid</span> sublime,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! good morning, dear doctor—you are very
good to favor us so early with a visit—look around
and see if you cannot find something here to your
taste. Your god-daughter has the small-pox—she
asks for her god-father every day—the dear little
Dileri!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I crossed my arms upon my breast and shook my
head—a pantomime which I have remarked in a
drama at the Theatre Ambigu means “what infamy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mademoiselle cast a sidelong glance at me—shrugged
her shoulders, and biting off a scarlet thread with
her teeth, said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the bye, dear doctor, I am married now—I
have been a wife fifteen days—Madame Telamon, at
your service. I will introduce you to my husband—a
very handsome man—you would scarcely reach to
his waist even if you raised yourself upon your toes.
Hold! here he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saluted her hastily, and left the shop furiously
angry, the more so that I was obliged to conceal my
rage. A single glance I gave toward the husband—real
or false—sufficed for me to recognize the pretended
decorator at the opera, who came to my box
to invite my judgment upon his Chinese kiosque.
That I had been the victim of a regular conspiracy
was very evident—resignation was my only
resource.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fortnight afterward I assumed a disguise, and
had the weakness to go and promenade before the
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
shop in the evening twilight, to catch a last glimpse
of the unworthy object of my idolatry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colossal husband was brushing the dust from
a mandarin in porcelain, and I heard him murmur,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that Doctor Sian Seng should attempt to set
his foot inside my door again, I’ll choke him, pack
him in straw, and sell his carcass to the doctors for
fifteen louis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh no! I shall never see this beautiful monster
again; I have the resolution of a man and of a philosopher;
I will fulfill my mission to the end, and
will again make myself worthy of you, oh! holy
city, which the silver moon illumines so caressingly
when from the top of Mount Tyryathon she hangs
like a lantern of silk from Nanking!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Paris there are physicians who devote themselves
entirely to specific diseases; there are some
who treat only infants at the breast; others, after
weaning; others who prescribe only for those of
sixty and above of it. Bills are stuck up at the corners
of all the streets, and advertisements in the
newspapers, proclaiming a thousand infallible receipts
for the six hundred maladies which the celebrated
Pi-ké has found to germinate in the human
body. They have discovered amongst other curious
things in physics, how to put a new nose upon faces
unfortunately deprived of that ornament, and to
elongate it when too short. They make teeth of
ivory for old men—hair for the bald—legs for those
who have lost them—eyes for the blind—tongues for
the dumb—ears for the deaf—brains for fools—and
have wonderful methods to resuscitate the dead.
But they forgot to invent one remedy—a cure for disappointed
love! In China we know nothing about
love; that passion was first discovered in France,
by a troubadour called Raymond—for five hundred
years it has ravaged fearfully. It is estimated that
eleven millions seven hundred and thirty-eight persons
have fallen victims to it, through assassinations,
languishing death, and suicide, caused by this scourge
of the human race—that amounts to double the number
of victims of cholera in Asia since the reign of
Aurengzebé. The French government have never
taken any means to stop the progress of this epidemic,
on the contrary, it pays largely toward the
support of four royal theatres, where they celebrate
the power of love and another mortal disease called
champagne. Mr. Scribe has made a fortune of five
hundred thousand francs a year, by celebrating the
delights of love and champagne for the governmental
theatres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In leaving the shop where my <span class='it'>Chinoiseries</span> were
sold by Mademoiselle Alexandrine de Saint Phar, I
had another violent attack of love; and you cannot
imagine how I cursed that rascal Raymond. Having
vented my rage where it was so well deserved, I
began to think seriously about a cure, and I walked
about the streets searching at every corner for some
advertisement of a remedy; useless trouble! I went
to the Hospital for Incurables, and asked the doctor
there whether he had not some patient afflicted with
this malady, so perfectly unknown in our harems;
but he only shrugged his shoulders, and turned his
back upon me. My head burned like fire—my heart
beat violently—my eyes glazed. The phantom of
Mademoiselle Alexandrine danced before my eyes
continually with fascinating grace, my ears were
filled with her silvery voice—alas! I lived only in
her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Physician cure thyself,” has said the wise Menu—this
thought suddenly occurred to me. Since the
French doctors have forgotten to invent a cure for
love, let us find a remedy; and we will give a
Chinese name to this grand consolation for suffering
Europe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I could live for a week without thinking of
Mademoiselle Alexandrine I should be saved! It
was impossible to remain in my lodgings, every
thing there reminded me of her, the faithless one!
Besides, solitude never cures the wounds of love, it
only festers them. Visits to the country are still
more dangerous. The streets, boulevards and theatres
are filled with women, and the species too often
reminds one of the individual traitress; still it is necessary
to live a week in total forgetfulness of the ungrateful fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fo has inspired me; let me render thanks to Fo!
Paris is filled with monuments, many of them very
high; I chose four from among them—the tower of
Notre Dame, the Pantheon, the Column Vendôme
and the tower of St. James; by the payment of a
few sous, one is permitted to ascend these towers,
which are kept by a tractable porter. I resolved to
pass some days in going up and down the stairs of
these monuments and towers without taking rest,
only, to vary the monotony of this continual ascent
and descent, I jumped into a cabriolet occasionally at
the Place Vendôme, drove to the Depôt of the Railroad
to Versailles, and traversed the distance to that
royal city five or six times, with my eyes shut.
When evening came I returned home, and, after a
slight repast, went to bed and slept soundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my dreams I imagined that huge giants poised
me in a swing, hung over the moon on a golden
nail, and the fright I had in such an alarming position
drove the phantom of Alexandrine from the boundless
space in which I undulated between the Pantheon
and the fixed stars!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eighth day the porters of the four towers
closed their doors against me, saying that I would
wear out their stairs! My cure not being complete,
I took to the road to Versailles, and hiring a carriage
by the day, drove first on one side of the river, and
then on the other, for five days longer, with the most
salutary fatigue—at the end of a fortnight my remedy
triumphed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In looking back upon my endless routine of dark
stairs—of dreamy swingings—and the ceaseless rumblings
of my carriage, I perceived in the hazy distance
the fleeting image of the false Alexandrine,
and it appeared as if my passionate love were like
the tale of a past age, or of an extinguished world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A single instant I was recalled to the sensible recollection
of her. In looking over my cash, I observed
the enormous void caused by the expenditure of the
3700 francs at Garbo &amp; Gamboi’s. The spirit of
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
Chinese ingenuity and enterprise inspired me with a
happy thought. I was upon the eve of recovering
my lost francs! I inserted an advertisement in all
the journals of the day, as follows:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>I did not expect such success as attended me.
What a city! what a people! How quickly do new
opinions become popular!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first day I had 300 visits for consultation at
20 francs each. The second I was obliged to seek at
the Prefecture of Police four gend’arms as a protection!
They took my office by assault. At length I
hit upon a plan of giving advice to classes of twelve
at a time, which in some measure reduced the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week following I gave public lectures at the
Athenæum, at five francs the ticket. Mr. Lefort
told me the fashion would not last long, and that I
should “make hay while the sun shone”—a proverb
Menu forgot to make!—besides, there was danger
that the prefect of police would close the monuments.
I therefore entered into a contract with the
porter at the Tower of St. James, to receive all my
patients who subscribed for a fortnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two trains to Versailles were filled with victims
with closed eyes! I was told that if I would
ask the minister for a patent, that he would probably
grant me a pension—as they did to Mr. Daguerre—of
six thousand francs a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My best reward, however, I found in the unanimous
gratitude of my relieved and happy patients;
they wanted to strike a gold medal in my honor!—unheard
of enthusiasm!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five of my most inveterate cases, aged from
twenty to fifty years, struck with an infatuation for
the vaudeville, of which I relieved them, became
great proselytes to my doctrines, and are determined
to prosecute it on their own account after my departure—they
even propose to purchase the Tower
of St. James by subscription, and add two hundred
more steps to the ascent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ti-en has given to the world no malady without
its cure; he has placed the water-lily by the side of
the pimento—the wood to make the sluice beside the
torrent of Kiang-ho. It is for man to discover the
remedy. Ti-en knows always what he does—and
<span class='it'>we</span>—we do what we know not!</p>

<p class='pindent'>My mind is now calm; my heart is light, as is
every thing which is empty. I shall now go and
take my leave of the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
and endeavor to correct the errors in diplomacy I
have made, since I have been possessed by the foot
of Mademoiselle Alexandrine de Saint Phar!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY FAYETTE ROBINSON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one knows of the Illinois River emptying
into the Mississippi at Alton, and of the fertile
champagne country it waters. All are familiar with
the traditions of the hardships undergone in its discovery
by the good fathers Hennepin and Marquette;
of the stirring wars of the Illinois, Potawatamie and
Peoria Indians, and of the recollections of that cordon
of military posts by which France united Detroit with
the great point d’appui of Fort Chartres, built near
where Trinity now stands, but of which scarcely a
trace remains, except a portion of the curtain and
bastions. These are the associations which rise in
the mind of most persons at the word Illinois, which
to me, however, is suggestive of another train of
ideas. In a south-western direction from the point
of confluence of the Gasconade and Missouri Rivers,
extends a broad chain of mountains, of which little
except the name Ozark is known. Many streams
which elsewhere would be esteemed large rivers
roll from its valleys northward into the Osage,
and in a southern direction into the Arkansas. After
crossing two-thirds of the state of Missouri, this
ridge passes through the north-west county of the
State of Arkansas, and thence reaches across the
country of the Cherokees and Chactas far into Texas.
Through the passes of this range many important
rivers flow, among which are the Arkansas, Red and
Canadienne. There is a striking peculiarity in this
mountain range—that all the waters flowing from it,
either northward or southward, are clear as crystal,
while all the other streams of the country are foul
and turbid. On one of these streams, the Neosho,
stands the lonely post of Fort Gibson, and twenty
miles below is another river called the Illinois. This
is not a large stream, measuring certainly not more
than a hundred miles, but is one of the most picturesque
imaginable. Flowing between two ridges of
the Ozark, it winds like a serpent around the bases of
the mountains, which now tower in immensity, clad
to their very summits with huge pines, or again gradually
decrease in size until they spread into rich
and luxuriant prairies. The road from Fort Gibson
to Fayetteville, in Arkansas, is along this stream,
which it crosses more than a dozen times, and thus
enables the traveler to behold all the wonderful
beauties of the scenery. Words cannot describe it
adequately. I have often in fording the river, which
may at many places be done without wetting the
saddle-girths, looked up the bed. Smooth and transparent
as glass, rolling over pebbles of silex and
crystal, it looks like a band of silver beneath the
arched boughs of the aspen and gigantic walnut
trees, while the immediate banks were fringed by
the long-leaved willow and cane. Not unfrequently
a single glance would reveal to me, when lost in
admiration at the quiet beauty of such a scene, another
of a far different yet equally pleasing style.
The current would quicken—small islets would appear,
scarcely more than a rood in breadth, against
which the waters would leap and lash themselves
into fury. The current would quicken yet more, and
in the distance a rugged mountain would be seen.
Against the base of this the waters would rush and
whirl into eddies over the seething surface of which
wild-fowl almost constantly floated. The low grounds
on the river abounded with the sloe or scuppanon,
and at distances of every mile or two, natural vineyards,
bearing a large, rich, luscious grape, without
a particle of the musky flavor which characterises
almost all the American <span class='it'>uvæ</span>, were seen. So immense
were these vines that they ran from tree to
tree, masking every thing with their foliage, and displaying
their grand clusters over the barren limbs of
the stunted oak or hickory. I have called the
Illinois a beautiful river, and have spoken of the
lucidness of its water—I can give an illustration of
the latter which is most apropos. Several years
since I was stationed on the bank of this stream with
a small detachment of men, and without any other
officer. In the long August days, when the prairies
were burned, and scarcely a breath of air was to be
had in the forests, I used to while away many weary
hours upon the banks of the river either fishing or
bathing. One day I amused myself with an Indian
lance in killing the fine buffalo-fish, which I could see
distinctly in the translucent waters. I had <span class='it'>posed</span> myself
on the bow of the boat in pursuit of one peculiarly
large fish which shot up the stream with the
rapidity of an arrow. The soldier who sat at the
stern of the boat, a very active and nervous man,
(he was killed, poor fellow, at the storming of Taos,
in New Mexico,) drove the boat after the quarry
with scarcely less rapidity. At last I had overtaken
him, the boat hung above him, like a gigantic leaf in
the atmosphere, which could scarcely be distinguished
from the water below. Poising myself, I drove the
lance into the fish, and a second afterward, to my
amazement, was floundering ten feet below the
surface of the water, and probably yet twenty from
the pebbly bottom. I would have sworn the water
was not more than four feet deep, and scrambled
out I know not how, for I could never swim—not,
however, until I had upset the boat and made poor
Orndorf a sharer in my calamity. The clearness of
the water, surpassing any thing I have ever seen, is
only approached by the one spring near Fort Fanning,
in Florida, upon which so much inquiry has been
expended. I would myself pronounce it the famous
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
fountain of health for which De Leon sought so long,
were it not that every human being who drinks of
its transparent waters, unless craftily qualified, dies
with that most loathsome of all diseases, the ague
and fever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first white man who ever trod in the valleys
of the Ozark was the famous Fernando de Soto.
About the year 1539 or 1540, this gallant soldier,
capitan-general of Florida, and a marquis, made a
voyage to his commandery, for the purpose of conquering
it. Sailing from Havana he landed at the
bay of the Holy Spirit, now called Tampa, Hillsborough,
Honda, etc., and occupied an Indian village
not far from the mouth of the Manittee River, and just
opposite the present post of Fort Brooke. The old
ruins are still visible there, and the trace of an aqueduct
or canal which appears at some distant day to
have connected the waters of the great interior lakes
with the gulf. People say the ruins are the remnant
of an old Spanish fort; but half a glance will satisfy
any one that all the Spanish troops ever in North
America could not have constructed that aqueduct,
which to all appearance is old as the city of Seville.
The ruins belonged evidently to some older race, and
are very curious though they have nothing to do
with De Soto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Soto marched through Florida across the country
of Apalache Indians, with whom he had a fight,
across the Mississippi toward Mexico. De Soto,
first of Europeans, saw the Mississippi, and crossed
it somewhere near Memphis, if the account given by
old Biedma, his historian, of topography be true.
Thence he now passed through the now State of
Arkansas, crossing the Ozark Ridge, passing over
the Red River, and marching along the false Wachita
until he came to the famous Rio Grande, since
famous for the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la
Palma, and celebrated by the Mexican poet,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Ho
Axe de Saltillo. De Soto did not reach New Spain,
but was forced to retrace his steps, died, and was
thrown by his soldiers into the Mississippi, to prevent
the natives from mutilating his remains. It was a
fitting tomb for so great a man. Any one who wishes
to read all the items of this great march may find
them in old Biedma’s strange book, in the <span class='it'>vidas de
los Conquistadores</span>, or as those books are somewhat
rare, in the Compendium of Discoveries until 1573,
by Conway Robinson, Esq., of Richmond, Va., a
person who devotes himself for amusement and relaxation
to digging out the gems of strange old books
most persons would think it hard work to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Soto first looked on these Ozark Mountains and
a weary time his men-at-arms, in coats of mail and
chain armor, must have had to climb them. They
were then, as they were until very recently, uninhabited,
and the home of all kinds of wild beasts
known on the continent. The black bear, the cougar,
catamount, deer and elk, were found among its ravines
and the glades at their foot, and even now old beaver-dams
attest the existence of those bestial republicans
on almost all the minor streams which run into the
Illinois. The land is barren, except upon the immediate
bank of the river, and the mountains seem
masses of pebbles similar in character to those over
which the river runs. Strangely enough gigantic
pines grow upon the mountains, the dark foliage of
which, seen even in the sunlight, looks, compared
with that of other trees, like the shadows cast by
what Schiller calls</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>Fliegende Wolken, Segler des Luft,</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>over the earth during a windy day of March. The
table-land, however, at the top of what I may call
the secondary hills, is covered with what are called
black-jacks, the ugliest and most ungainly of all
things on the surface of the earth, not excepting the
Mexican cactus, which is like no other thing animal
or vegetable, except the porcupine. The hills seem
vast masses of limestone, with the granite occasionally
showing itself. I have no doubt of the richness
of the soil in mineral wealth, copper being everywhere
apparent, and the Ozark Mountains evidently
connecting themselves with the Sierra Madre and
Cordillera of Mexico. Some day the gold-hunter
will deform this beautiful land, the vast groves and
of timber which crown its mountains will fall. Worse
than all, the picturesque Illinois will be deformed and
forced to pass through some series of plank troughs
in the gold-washing establishment of Messrs. Jones,
Smith &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1837 these mountains were uninhabited. One
road wound among the intricacies of the mountains
between Fort Gibson and the village of Fayetteville.
After leaving the Methodist Mission of Prospect Hill
smoke was scarcely seen by the traveler until he
had entered the limits of Arkansas. There were a
few hunting and bridle-paths, leading in a direction
parallel to the road, which were frequented exclusively
by the smugglers engaged in the nefarious
business of selling whiskey to the Indians. Since
then a mighty change has taken place. On the removal
of the Cherokee Indians west, the North
Carolina band selected these hills as most like their
old homes and established themselves among them.
Hamlets grew up in the valleys and farms were
opened; so that in a short time the intelligent Cherokee
citizens, second to no agricultural class in the
world, followed in their train, and large plantations
were opened. One of these colonists, the well-known
chief, Bushyhead, has a magnificent estate comprising
a prairie and grove of about one thousand acres,
which has none to surpass it in the country. A
wooded knoll rises at the back of his house, to the
heighth of about 250 feet, and on a calm summer-day
the ripple of the Illinois may be heard in the distance
through the forests and green corn-fields. The writer
has often partaken of his hospitality, and has been
a witness of the prosperity and happiness of his
whole household, Indian and Negro, (he has many
slaves.) This happiness would be without alloy but
that the Indian always knows he is but a tenant at
will of the soil he stands upon, and looks back, perhaps
with regret, to the days when his forefathers
wandered in savage independence on the shores of
the Atlantic. On the other side of the Neosho River
the mountains are higher and wilder, and even now
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
desolate; and in the year 1840 I crossed that portion
of the ridge on duty, and have a strange tale to
tell of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a furlough of some years, I returned in 1840
to the west, and after reporting for duty to the headquarters
of the department, was ordered to join a
squadron of my regiment then stationed on the Red
River. The navigation of the western rivers was
then most uncertain, and I was ordered to cross the
intermediate country by land instead of trusting to
the tortuous navigation of the Arkansas, emphatically
one of those streams of which John Randolph said,
“they were dry in summer and choked up with
ice during the winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old officers of the post told me I might easily
have my orders changed by applying to the general,
and advised me to do so, as my route lay through a
peculiarly wild and desolate country. They told me
what they had heard of the Ozark Mountains, of the
precipices and torrents, the almost impassable <span class='it'>resacas</span>,
<span class='it'>etc.</span> I was, however, an old <span class='it'>coureur des bois</span>,
and all this but stimulated me to attempt the passage.
Fort Gibson lay at the head of navigation at that
time, though steamboats have since passed far above
the Cape Farewell of 1840. Similarly situated was
Fort Towson, on the Red River; between the two
lay the country of the Cherokees, Chactas, and Chichasas,
and many formidable rivers, such as the
Canadienne, the Verdigris, and the whole of the
southern tributaries of the Arkansas. To cross this
country with all its difficulties on the first Wednesday
in April, 1810, I left Fort Gibson, with no equipage,
or what Cæsar calls <span class='it'>impedimenta</span>, other than one
pack mule, loaded with provisions, and a servant,
like myself, mounted, who rejoiced in the name of
Barny. I often wonder what has become of him,
and whether, like Latour d’Auvergne, first grenadier
of France, he may not have “died on the field
of glory,” during the Mexican war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As my orders contained no recommendation to
make the journey with peculiar rapidity, and as I
was aware that nothing awaited me at Fort Towson
but the monotonous existence of a subaltern, I
loitered along the road systematically, as a veteran
colonel <span class='it'>en route</span> to reinforce a militia general, and
on Sunday lay by on the banks of a picturesque
stream, whiling away time with my rod and angle,
which Isack Walton recommends as “fosterers of
meditation, and gratitude to God for having made so
many fine fish for man’s especial benefit,” and which
I was too old a soldier to be without in the North
American wilderness. Monday broke upon me cold
and chill, and wearied even by my voluntary halt, I
set out to continue my journey. There had been
during the night a mist and sleet, so that the prairie,
which on the day before had looked like a garden
covered with periwinkles, the beautiful wild indigo,
and the sensitive-plant, was now become a glacier.
I rode on, therefore, wrapped in the cape of my
dragoon cloak, and scarcely noticing what passed
around me. Few persons except half-breeds had
ever crossed the prairie in this direction before,
and having to depend merely on general direction
for my course, it is not surprising that I became lost.
Any one ever lost in the north-western prairie is
aware that when once astray, every attempt at correction
makes matters worse, and what with the
uniformity of the whole face of the country, at nightfall
I was utterly bewildered. I was forced to encamp
on the bald prairie, sacrificing to my comfort
the solitary tree which I afterward learned was a
land-mark. It made a very bad fire, being filled with
sap, but sufficed to broil a rasher of bacon which,
with a cup of coffee transformed into what the
Spaniards call a <span class='it'>gloria</span> by a glass of “old corn,”
constituted my supper. The sleet had by this time
disappeared, and the cattle hobbled and allowed to
wander at will, fared better than I, on the young
prairie grass, which they relished not a little after
their dry provender at Fort Gibson. Tuesday came
fair and bright, and far in the distance I saw one of
the Ozark’s peaks rising tall and solitary in just the
direction I had not been marching on the day before.
To it I directed my course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The country soon became broken, and on each
side of me rose rough hills. I knew at once I would
be forced to cross the ridge, and set manfully to the
task. As I progressed the scenery became every
mile more grand, and I began to be thankful for the
accident which had led me into the bewildering maze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have stood on tall mountains, having threaded
the Alleghany, and looked on the boldest peaks of
wilder lands. Above rose a tall peak with half precipitous
sides, its base skirted with a dense growth
of the Osage orange. This strange and peculiar
tree merits a more minute description. It belongs,
I believe, to the same genus with the box-tree of our
forest, for from its limbs and leaves, when broken,
exudes a milky gelatinous humor, not unlike that of
the fig and India-rubber plant. Its leaves are smooth
and glazed and so precisely like those of the Florida
orange that the two cannot easily be distinguished.
It bears a large fruit in character similar to the balls
of the sycamore, but which becomes during the
process of decay a noisome pulp, and is said to be a
deadly poison. The size of the fruit is about that of
the cocoa-nut, divested of its husk, and the heighth of
the tree about thirty-five feet, with thick, gnarled
limbs, covered with long, straight spines, like those of
the honey <a id='acacia1'></a>acacia. By the Canadian colonists of
Arkansas and the French of Louisiana it was called
the <span class='it'>bois d’arc</span>, from the fact that of this the Natches
and Opelousas made their bows. This beautiful
growth is now rapidly disappearing, it having been
discovered that it furnishes a dye of a brilliant yellow,
long a desideratum in the arts. During the last few
years many cargoes have been sent to France, and
the cutting it has, like the procuring of log-wood,
become a distinct and important branch of industry.
Many stories are told of this tree which would make
us believe it exerts an influence scarcely less baleful
than that of the fabulous Upas tree of Borneo, popular
superstition attributing to it the deadly disease of
man and brute known as the “milk sickness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The base of the peak before me was skirted with
thickets of this beautiful tree, intermingled with the
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
dog-wood, then in the glory of its flower, and three
or four varieties of the <a id='acacia2'></a>acacia and Canadian redbud.
Here and there on the very hill-side were expanses
grown up with the tall green-cane and the beautiful
Mexican oats. Through such a growth I commenced
my ascent, and soon passed by the sinuosities of an
Indian trail into an expanse of cupriferous volcanic
rock, almost without any other growth than the red-root,
or Indian tea. Passing through this, I came
into a belt of tall pines, reaching far above the crest
of the peak. No engineer could have constructed a
glacis with a more regular inclination than this portion
of the mountain displayed. At last I stood upon
the crest, and a prospect opened before me I have
never seen surpassed or equaled. I was on the
very backbone of the ridge, and before me lay a succession
of peaks, gradually descending into the bosom
of a vale perhaps ten miles wide, while beyond
this happy valley rose another ridge, parallel, descending
gradually as the one on which I stood had
become elevated. A clear, cold stream ran at the
foot of the peak on which I was, and amid the
stillness of a calm spring day I distinctly heard the
murmur of its ripples. Down the bleak hill-sides of
the other ridge I could trace more than one silver
line which marked the descent of tributary rills. I
could have remained long on that bald mountain-peak,
but was warned by the descent of the sun to
proceed downward. Taking the horses by the bridle,
for I committed the care of the pack-mule to poor
Barny, I began carefully to follow the pathway, and
was ultimately enabled to reach the base in spite of
sundry falls of the heavy pack, which, in spite of discipline,
wrung hearty curses from poor Barny’s
over-burdened heart. I encamped at the foot of the
peak, on a branch of the Boggy, or <span class='it'>Bogue</span>, itself a
tributary of the Red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After many days of painful travel, precisely similar
to the one I have described, except that the western
ridge was more difficult than the eastern, I reached
the prairie through which the Red River runs. On
the summit of several of the peaks I had found large
springs and pools of water, and in the valleys the
streams expanded into beautiful lakes. In some of
these valleys were grand groves of the wild-plum,
and a variety of other growths, among which was
the iron-wood and box-elder. The cotton-wood, so
common northward, has disappeared. At last I
arrived at Fort Towson. I had missed the direction,
and to reach a point about one hundred miles from
Gibson, had traveled three. Twenty miles after
leaving the latter post, I had seen the smoke of not
one hearth till I reached the yellow water, about ten
miles from Fort Towson, yet during all this time I
had been in a small labyrinth of mountains, surrounded
on all sides by the dense population of the
Cherokee and Chickasa nation, the Opeloulas of
Louisiana and Western Texas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I afterward was informed that the Indian path I
had more than once passed was a portion of the
great Delaware trail which crosses the whole American
continent, from Erie, in Pennsylvania, to
California, and which marks the migration of those
American Gitanos from the homes where the white
man found them to the chief seat of the tribe on the
Missouri River, to the outposts on the Red River
and on the Pacific. Along it they still go, and not
unfrequently two of their well-armed and gallant
braves will fight their way through hordes of hostile
and degenerate Indians of the prairie. It will be
found always to cross the streams at the most fordable
point, and he who strays from it to avoid travel,
will generally find that the longest way round is the
nearest way home. After my arrival at Fort Gibson
I did not regret my mistake, which had made me
acquainted with so beautiful a country; and I hope
my reader is weary neither of the Illinois River or
the Ozark Mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sitting one morning in the library of a
friend, looking over a valuable collection of works
of art, made during a five years residence abroad,
and listening to his animated description of scenes
and places now become familiar to every one who
reads at all, through the medium of “Jottings,”
“Impressions,” and “Travels,” with which the
press abounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the paintings were small copies in oil from
Corregio, Guercino, Guido, and Rafaelle. There
was a head of the latter, copied from a portrait
painted by himself, and preserved in the Pitti Palace.
With the slightest shade of hectic on the cheek, and
the large unfathomable eyes looking into the great
beyond, it was truly angelic in its loveliness. No
wonder the man for whom nature had done so much,
and who delighted in portraying the loftiest ideal
beauty, no wonder he was called “divine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said my friend, lovingly holding forth one
of those inimitable creations, the beauty of which
once seen, haunts us for a lifetime, “here is the far-famed
‘violin-player,’ the friend of Rafaelle. By
the bye, I must tell you an anecdote I heard while
abroad. There were two gentlemen sight-seers looking
at pictures in the Vatican; one called to the other,
who was at a short distance from him, ‘come, look
at this, here is the celebrated violin-player.’ ‘Ah!’
said his companion, hastening toward him, ‘Paganini!’
I give you the story as I heard it related for
truth, and as a somewhat laughable example of
traveled ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one side of the room in which we were conversing,
stood a picture apart from all the others,
which soon engrossed my entire attention. A young
man was represented reclining on a couch, and
wrapped in a robe falling in loose folds about his
person. His countenance bore the traces of suffering,
but his dark eyes were filled with the light of love,
and hope, as they looked up into the face of a young
female bending mournfully at his side. On the head
of this female the artist had lavished all the <span class='it'>love</span> of
genius. With the sunny hair parted on the fair forehead,
and the rich braids simply confined by a silver
arrow—the dark eyes from which the tears seemed
about to fall—the half-parted lips quivering as if from
intense devotion—oh, it was transcendently lovely!
The rest of the figure was in outline, but as vividly
portrayed as some of those wonderful illustrations
by Flaxman, in which a single line reveals a story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is this,” said I, after gazing long and earnestly
upon it, “how is this?—why is the picture unfinished.
And who was the painter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tale,” replied my friend, “is a sad one; and
if you are tired of looking at pictures and medals, I
will relate it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not tired, yet I should like to hear the story to
which this picture imparts an unusual interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember Paul Talbot, who left here some
years ago to pursue the study of his art abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, but that young man—sick—almost dying—I
thought the face a familiar one; but can that be
Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! yes—he is dead!” and my friend dashed
away a tear as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead!” repeated I. “Paul Talbot dead! when
did he die?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not long before my return. Poor fellow! he
endured much, and his career was an exemplification
of what a man of untiring energy can accomplish
under the most adverse circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon after the birth of Paul, his father died,
leaving little, save a mother’s love and a stainless
reputation to his infant son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Talbot was a man of refined taste, and had
collected round him objects of which an amateur
might be justly proud—and thus from childhood had
been fostered Paul’s love for the beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well educated and accomplished, Mrs. Talbot
undertook the tuition of her child, and by giving
lessons in drawing, painting miniatures on ivory,
and small portraits in oil, kept herself and her boy
above the pressure of want. Carefully she instilled
into his tender mind those lofty principles of rectitude,
of uncompromising integrity, and that child-like
trust in the goodness of an overruling Providence,
which sustained him through all the trials of after
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How holy, how powerful is the influence of a
mother! The father may do much, but the mother
can do more toward the formation of the mind, and
the habits of early childhood. Exercising a power,
silent, yet refreshing as the dews of heaven, her least
word, her lightest look, sinks deep into the hearts of
her children, and moulds them to her will. How
many men have owed all that has made them great
to the early teachings of a mother’s love! The father,
necessarily occupied with business or professional
duties, cannot give the needful attention to the minor
shades in the character and disposition of his little
ones, but the mother can encourage and draw out
the latent energies of the timid, can check the bold,
and exert an influence which may be felt not only
through time, but through eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was beautiful to see Paul Talbot standing by
his mother’s side, with his childish gaze fixed upon
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
her face, while receiving instruction from her lips,
and to hear him as he grew in years, wishing he was
a man, that he might be enabled to supply her every
want.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘You know,’ he would exclaim, while his fine
eyes was flashing with enthusiasm, ‘that I will be an
artist; and, oh, mother, if I could, like Washington
Allston, be a painter-poet; could I but paint such a
head as that we saw in the Academy, and write
such a book as Monaldi, then, mother, I would gain
fame; orders would crowd upon me—and then—then
we would go to Italy!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to Italy! of this he thought by day, and
dreamed by night; and to accomplish this was the
crowning ambition of the boy’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was willing to toil, to endure privation and
fatigue, could he but visit that land where heavenly
beauty is depicted on the canvas, where the marble
wants but the clasp of him of old to warm it into life,
and where the soft blue of the sky, and the delicious
atmosphere brooding over the glories of centuries
gone by, make it the Mecca of the artist’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But amid all these dreams of the future, all these
ambitious aspirings of the gifted youth, death cast his
dark shadow over that peaceful dwelling, and the
mother, the guardian angel of the fatherless boy, was
borne away to be a dweller in the silent land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With what passionate earnestness did he call
upon her name. How did he long to lie down by
her side. His mother! his mother! she had taught
his lisping accents their first prayer; she had watched
over his little bed, and moistened his parched lips
when he was ill with fever—so ill, that his mother’s
watchful tenderness was all, under God, that saved
him from the grave. As he grew older, she had
spoken to him, not like the boy he was in years, but
like the man to whom she would impart her thoughts,
and with whose mind of almost premature development,
she might hold converse, and feel herself
understood. And now, in his fifteenth year, when
he was thinking of all that he could, nay, of all that
he <span class='it'>would</span> do for her, his mother had died! Who
can wonder that the boy pined, and sat upon her
grave, and longed for her companionship, and wept
as if his heart must break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abstracted in his habits, quiet and sensitive, from
his reveries in dream-land, the orphan woke to find
himself the inmate of a new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Winter, the only sister of the late Mr.
Talbot, was wholly unlike her brother. With little
taste for the elegancies of life, except so far as she
thought their possession would give her importance
in the eyes of others, with no sympathy for any ambition
save that of acquiring money, she looked with
no very favorable eye on her brother’s orphan.
Dazzled by the prospect of a carriage, a town and
country-house in perspective, she had married a man
of sixty, when she was barely sixteen, and could
never forgive her brother for not falling in with her
scheme of catching the rich heiress, who, she avowed,
waited but the asking to change the name of Miss
Patty Pringle, for the more lofty-sounding title of
Mrs. Percy Talbot. But Percy Talbot preferred the
portionless Isabel Morton, and the monotony of a
counting-room, to the bank-stock, real estate, and
soulless face of Miss Patty Pringle. Hence there
was little intercourse between the brother and sister,
and when the younger Talbot sought the shelter of
his aunt’s roof, she animadverted with great bitterness
on the folly of people gratifying a taste for
luxuries beyond their means, and encouraging boys
without a shilling to spend their time in reading
books and daubing canvas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor could Mrs. Winter refrain from talking of
stupidity, when Paul sat quietly at his drawing,
while her own sons were making the house ring with
their boisterous mirth. The boys, catching the spirit
of their mother, ridiculed Paul’s sketches, and with
the petty tyranny of little minds, subjected him to
every annoyance, and taunted him with his dependent
state. The proud, sensitive boy, writhed under
such treatment, and determined on leaving the relatives
who had neither tastes nor sympathies in
common with his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When at the age of twelve years, he hung over
the landscape he was trying to imitate, and from
which no boyish sports could lure him; when he saw
the sketch grow beneath his touch, and look more
and more like the original, until in the exultation of
his young heart, he exclaimed, ‘I knew that I could
do it if I did but try,’ he unconsciously displayed that
perseverance of character without which no one can
hope to attain eminence. And now that same energy
was employed in seeking means to gain a livelihood
without being subjected to the bitterness of insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He succeeded in obtaining a situation in a dry-good
store, and in compensation for his services, received
his board and a scanty salary. True, he had
but little, but that little was his own; he had earned
it, and a proud feeling of independence was his, when
purchasing the scanty stock of drawing materials
with money obtained by his own exertions. And
so passed a few years, during which he diligently
devoted himself to the business of his employer
through the day, and to reading and drawing at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The long cherished hope of visiting Italy had
never been abandoned, although the many obstacles
in the way seemed almost insurmountable. But now
a bright thought occurred to him; ‘I will give up my
situation; I will hire a room with the money already
saved, and devote myself entirely to the pursuit of
art. I shall paint a picture—it will be placed in the
exhibition—and then—’ Talbot paused, and his
cheek glowed, and his heart-pulse quickened as he
looked into the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The resolution once taken, he was not long in
carrying it into effect; and day after day saw him at
his easel, laboring with patient assiduity, and flattering
himself that his picture would not pass unnoticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the day of exhibition arrived, Talbot walked
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
nervously up and down the gallery where the pictures
were hanging, every now and then glancing at
his own, with the small ticket appended announcing
it for sale, and pausing to observe if it attracted attention.
But it had been placed in a bad light, directly
beneath two brightly-tinted landscapes, and so low
down that you were obliged to put one knee on the
floor before it could be examined. Poor Paul! no
one gave more than a passing glance to what had
cost you weeks of patient labor, and the papers passed
it by with merely announcing its name and number
on the catalogue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a rude dashing down of all his hopes was
here! What a fading of the air-built castles he had
taken such delight in building? The land of promise
had receded from his view, and the shores of Italy
were as a far-off vision seen in the dimness of deepening
twilight. Oh, what a sinking of the heart
follows such disappointments! A goal is to be won—the
aspirant rushes eagerly to the race—hope lures
him on—he grows weary, oh, how weary—courage—the
thrilling sound of fame’s trumpet-peal is ringing
on those heights afar—courage—one more struggle
and the prize will be his own! One more struggle—and
hope fades from his sight—and the last faint
echo of fame’s music dies upon his ear—and a dull
lethargy seizes on his mind—and the pulses of his
heart grow still and cold as the waveless, tideless
surface of a deep, dark lake! Happy he who can
shake off the despondency attendant on times like
these, and, like the bird momentarily driven back
by the storm, can plume his wings and dare a nobler
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spirits of youth are elastic, and after great
pressure will naturally rebound. ‘Hope on, hope
ever,’ is a maxim seldom forgotten until age has
chilled the blood and palsied the powers of life.
After a few days spent in brooding over the present,
Paul again looked forward to the future, and determined
to seek some other avenue by which he might
gather up a little, just a little, of the treasure which
others possessed in such abundance. His fondness
for literature suggested the idea that his pen might
be employed with more profit than his pencil, and
the periodicals of the day appeared to offer a wide
field for exertion. But emolument from such sources
was precarious at best. All who held an established
reputation in the world of letters were contributors
to the various popular publications, and Paul Talbot
wanted the “magic of a <span class='it'>name</span>” to win <span class='it'>golden</span> opinions
from the Press. Sometimes he met with those
who were more just, and more generous, and thus
encouraged he toiled on, hoping even against hope,
that his desires would yet be accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With many misgivings, and a fear that he had
mistaken his vocation, he had taken his ill-fated picture
to a place where engravings were kept for sale,
and left it with the shopkeeper, promising to pay him
one half the money for which it might be sold. How
discouraging to see it week after week in the window,
until it began to look like a soiled fixture of the
establishment. No one would ever buy it, that was
certain, and if they would not purchase this his best
work, how could he ever hope to dispose of others
of less merit, which were standing round the walls
of his little room? Alas, no! but when once in
Italy—then he would paint pictures such as he
dreamed of in imagination. For the present, with
weary frame and throbbing brow, he must Labor on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are few but know</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>‘How cruelly it tries a broken heart</p>

<p class='noindent'>And who that has ever walked forth on a particularly
bright morning, when he was nursing a deep sorrow,
or was weighed down by the pressure of misfortune,
but felt annoyed by the light, and noise, and cheerfulness
around him? Those vast tides of human life
what are they to him? He is but a drop in a wave
of the mighty ocean—but a pebble thrown upon the
sand—a broken link in the great chain of the Universe.
Thus felt Paul, as on one of the loveliest
days of laughing June, he wended his way to the
office where he had left a manuscript to be examined
by the publisher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘How can those people look so smilingly,’ thought
he, while glancing at the well-dressed groups on the
side-walk. ‘And those children, how noisy they are—and
see that carriage with its liveried attendants—pshaw!’
Now Paul was not envious, and he was
particularly fond of children, but the feeling of loneliness
in the crowd was oppressive, and with another
half audible pshaw! he turned into a quieter
street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The smiling face of the great man who employed
so many subordinates in his large establishment,
somewhat reassured the desponding youth, and after
a little preliminary talk about encouraging native
talent, a sum was offered, which, though small in
itself, was just then a god-send to the needy Paul,
who with many thanks bowed himself out of the
publisher’s presence. One ray of light had dawned
on his darkened path, one beam of hope had shed its
warmth upon his heart, and how differently now
looked the scene through which he had lately passed!
With buoyant step he went on. He, too, could
smile,—the darling little ones, how delighted he was
to see them looking so happy—and the poor blind
man at the corner must not be forgotten! Like the
child who plays with the kaleidoscope, and every moment
sees some new beauty, so Paul toyed with the
many-colored hues in the rainbow of Hope, grouping
them together in the most beautiful and dazzling
forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was destined to be a red-letter day in his book
of life. As he passed the print-shop he saw that his
picture was gone from the window. It had been
sold, and a companion-piece ordered by the purchaser.
‘Oh that my mother were living!’ sighed
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
Paul—‘oh that my mother were living, we might
yet go to Italy!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again the painter laid aside his pen and resumed
his pallet. The one order was executed, the money
transferred to his slender purse, and even now he
began to think how much might be put aside for his
darling project.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Could I but obtain enough to pay for my passage—once
there, in that delicious climate, I could
live on so little. Oh that some one would buy this,’
he continued, taking up a small picture on which he
had bestowed unusual care, ‘it is worth more than
either of the others. I shall leave it with the kind
Mr. Barry; how generous he was in refusing the
commission I promised him for the last one he sold.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barry, at whose print-shop Paul had left his
first picture, had kindly drawn from him the story of
his life, and felt deeply interested in the young artist’s
changing fortunes, but, like many other generous-hearted
men, he was always forming schemes for
the benefit of others, which his means would not
permit him to accomplish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The kind man had just reared a goodly super-structure
of greatness, upon a rather sandy foundation,
for his young protégé, when Paul entered with
the new work fresh from his easel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Why, Talbot,’ said he, cordially grasping the
painter’s hand, ‘this is capital! and I consider myself
a tolerably good judge. When younger, I was
in the employ of a picture-dealer, who pursued the
profitable business of making old pictures look like
new, and the still more profitable one of making new
pictures look like old. You stare, it is a fact, I assure
you. To a Madonna, that had been bought for a trifling
sum, I had the honor of imparting a time-worn
tinge, which so took the fancy of an amateur, that
he paid two hundred and fifty dollars for it at auction.
But I never could endure cheating, so I left the picture
manufactory, and commenced the sale of prints
on my own account.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Do you think there is any chance of selling this
Landscape?’ inquired Paul. ‘I will take fifteen dollars
for it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Why, Talbot, you are foolish, it is worth at
least fifty.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Ah, no one would give me so large a sum for
a picture; fifty dollars! that would almost take me
to Italy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Well, well, my dear fellow, it is said, Providence
helps those who help themselves, and you are
sure to be helped in some way or other. I was thinking
about you this morning, and wrote a note of introduction
to Mr. C., who is a great patron of the
Fine Arts. I have told him of your desire to go
abroad, and how you are situated—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Nay, nay, my kind friend,’ interrupted Paul,
‘this looks too much like begging a favor, remember
I cannot sacrifice my independence, even to secure
the accomplishment of my most ardent wishes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘You are wrong, Talbot, you do not solicit him
for aid; he has a taste for art, and if he give you
money, you return an equivalent in your picture, so
that the obligation is mutual.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul was persuaded, and, bearing his friend’s
letter, bent his way to a fine-looking house, a long
way from his own abode. Upon ringing the bell, he
was informed by the servant that the family were at
dinner. Leaving the letter with the waiter, he desired
him to hand it to Mr. C., and say that Mr. Talbot
would call to-morrow evening. The next evening
Mr. C. was engaged, and on the next, when
Paul was ushered into the drawing-room, and his
name announced, he received a stately and patronizing
bow from a short, stout gentleman, who stood
with his back to the fire, conversing with three or
four more who were seated near him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Take a seat, sir,’ and the short man waved his
hand toward the intruder, and resumed the conversation
thus momentarily interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul grew nervous, and taking advantage of a
pause he rose, and bowing slightly, advanced toward
Mr. C. for the purpose of speaking. The latter began
first—‘I have looked over Mr. Barry’s letter,
young man, and hardly think it will be in my power
to assist you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘I came not seeking assistance, sir,’ replied
Paul; ‘my friend Mr. Barry thought you might perhaps
wish to add another picture to your collection,
and, as I purpose going abroad, assured me that you
would cheerfully give a few lines of introduction to
your young countryman.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Well, well, we will see, we <a id='will'></a>will see, but all
you young men have taken it into your heads that
you must travel, and this makes so many applicants.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Applicants!’ the word stung Paul to the quick,
and again bowing to Mr. C., he left the apartment.
Once in the free air of heaven, he gave vent to his
suppressed feelings, and vowed that should be his
first and last visit to a patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barry was indignant when he heard the non-success
of his young friend. ‘Why, Talbot, that
man’s name is bruited abroad as a most liberal patron
of Art, a fosterer of early genius, an encourager
of native talent—how I have been deceived!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Never mind, my dear friend, you will sell the
picture to some one else, and I will conquer yet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Paul Talbot did conquer. When another
year had gone by, he stood with the hand of his
friend Barry clasped in his own, returning the warm
‘God bless you,’ fervently uttered by the old man in
that hour of parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a wild tumult of feeling, half joy half sorrow,
he stood upon the deck of the vessel, and watched
the shores of his native land as they faded in the
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul Talbot is in the city of wonders. Ivy-girdled
ruins of the time-embalming Past are lying
in the distance. Lofty cathedrals, rich in votive
offerings of surpassing magnificence, surround him
on every side. Stately palaces, their long galleries
filled with the noblest works of the mighty minds of
old, are baring their treasures to his gaze. The ‘dew-dropping
coolness’ of the marble fountain, breathes
new vigor into his frame. He is excited—bewildered—‘dazzled
and drunk with beauty,’ and for weeks
Paul wandered about Rome and its environs, half
forgetful that his lot was still to struggle and to toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When roused to action, he threw himself heart
and soul into his art, and the consequence was a
long and severe illness, brought on by that absorbing
devotion which often kept him at his pursuits until
the morning dawn peering into his room reminded
him that he was weary and overtasked. For months
he lay wasted by sickness, helpless at times as a
feeble child, but nature triumphed over disease, and
he wandered once more beneath the blue sky, and
felt the kiss of the balmy air upon his pallid cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a return to health, Paul returned with renewed
ardor to his task, until the picture on which
he had long and earnestly labored was at length completed.
He had chosen for his subject a scene representing
the Hermit Peter exhorting the people to join
the crusaders. Standing in the midst, with one arm
outstretched, and the other raised to heaven, was
seen the enthusiast. On either side, were grouped
mailed knights and <a id='stalwart'></a>stalwart forms, the tillers of the
soil. One gentle lady, like the weeping Andromeda,
was clinging to her lord, and a villager’s wife held up
her child for his father’s last fond kiss. So animated
and life-like was the figure of the preacher—so
eager and intense the emotion betrayed by the assembled
multitude—that you listened to hear the eloquence
that roused all Europe, and sent prince, peer,
and peasant to rescue the holy sepulchre from the
hand of the Infidel, to cast down the crescent of Mohammed,
and to raise the cross of Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now came that fame for which the young
painter had toiled, and to which he had looked forward
as his highest guerdon. Crowds were daily
drawn to his <span class='it'>atelier</span>, and artists who had themselves
won a world-wide renown, bestowed their warmest
praises upon the ‘Hermit’ of Paul Talbot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The following winter Paul passed in Florence,
and there his picture was <a id='purchased'></a>purchased by a Florentine
merchant, at a price which relieved the artist from
fear of pecuniary embarrassment. Paul was requested
to visit the house of the merchant, and select
the most fitting place to display the work of which
the fortunate possessor was so justly proud. He
went, and in the picture-gallery of the wealthy
Florentine was opened a new page in the artist’s
book of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poets and painters have ever an eye for beauty
in women; and when Carlotta D. entered the apartment,
leaning on the arm of her father, Paul started
as if one of the bright visions of his ideal world stood
suddenly embodied before him. The lady, too, was
for a moment half-embarrassed—for the fame of the
young painter had reached her ears, and, womanlike,
she had been wondering if report spoke truly
when it ascribed to him the dark clustering locks,
and the lustrous eyes of her own sunny south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it strange that Paul and Carlotta, both worshipers
of the beautiful, with souls alive to the most
holy sympathies of our nature, was it strange that
they should love?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul had hitherto lived for his art alone. Painting
was the mistress he had ever wooed with intense
passion, but now another claimed his homage, and
he bowed with a fervor little less than idolatrous at
woman’s shrine. Such a love could not long remain
concealed. The father of Carlotta, a vain and
purse-proud man, hoping by his wealth to obtain a
husband for his daughter among some of the haughty
but decayed nobility, frowned on the artist, and forbade
him his house. In secret the lovers plighted
their troth, and parted, not knowing when they
should meet again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul left Florence with the resolve to win not
fame alone, but wealth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Rome he was enrolled a member of the
Academy of St. Luke, under Overbeck—the spiritually-minded
Overbeck—who himself the son of a
poet, has enriched his art with the divinely poetical
conceptions of his own pencil. At Munich, one of
his pictures was shown by Cornelius to the king of
Bavaria, and purchased by that munificent patron of
art at a price far exceeding the painter’s expectations.
At Vienna a similar success attended him, and he
returned to Florence after an absence of six years,
with fame, and wealth enough for the foundation of
a fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Carlotta he had rarely heard, but he knew
her heart was his, and he had that faith in her character
as a true woman, which made him believe
that no entreaties or commands of her father would
induce her to wed another. And Paul was right—Carlotta
D. still remained unmarried. In her the
budding loveliness of the girl had expanded into the
fuller beauty of the woman, but Talbot was sadly
altered. The feverish excitement—the continued
toil—the broken rest—the anxiety of thought to
which he had been subjected, undermined his health,
and planted the seeds of that insidious disease, which,
while it wastes the bodily strength, leaves the mind
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
unimpaired, and the hope of the sufferer buoyed to
the last. The father of Carlotta finding that neither
persuasion nor coercion could make his high-souled
daughter barter her love for a title, consented at last
that she should become the bride of the artist; but
many said the wily Florentine had given his consent
the more readily, because he saw that Paul
would not long be a barrier in the way of his ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul Talbot had buffeted the adverse waves of
fortune; he had gained renown in a land filled with the
most exquisite creations of the gifted; he had won a
promised bride. Whence, in that bright hour loomed
the one dark cloud that blotted the stars from the sky?
Could it be the shadow of the tomb? Was death
interweaving his gloomy cypress with the laurel on
the painter’s brow? Oh, no, no—he was but weary—he
only wanted rest, and his powers would again
be in full vigor. Then, with Carlotta at his side—with
her smile to cheer him on—he would aim higher,
and yet higher in his art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the young wife was deceived. Although a
nameless dread, a dark prescience lay heavy at her
heart, she yet thought the bright flush on the cheek
of Paul a sign of returning health. How tenderly
and anxiously she watched lest he should fatigue
himself at his easel, and how gently she chid, and
lured him from his task into the open air of their
beautiful garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the days thus passed had been deliciously
mild, and, although mid-winter, in that heavenly
climate where flowers are ever blooming in the open
air, each breeze was laden with the heavy odor of
the orange blossom, and the fainter perfume of the
Provence rose. Stepping lightly from the balcony
where Paul and she had been seated watching the
piled-up masses of crimson, of purple, and of gold
that hung like regal drapery round the couch of the
western sun, Carlotta pushed aside the opening
blossoms of the night-jasmine which intercepted her
reach, and gathering a handful of rose-buds, carried
them to Paul. He took the flowers from his wife,
and looking mournfully upon them, said, ‘When
we cross the waters to visit my native land, we will
take with us some of your precious roses, beloved,
and beautify my mother’s silent home; and now,’ he
continued, twining his arm round her waist, and
leading her to the harp, ‘sing me that little song I
wrote while yet a student in old Rome.’ Pressing
her lips upon his brow, Carlotta seated herself, and
sung the song, which she had set to music. The air
was soft and melancholy, and the sweet tones of the
singer were tremulous with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘My dear Paul,’ said his wife, smiling through
the tears with which, in spite of her efforts to repress
them, her eyes were suffused, ‘this sad song should be
sung on the last night of the year, the night for which
it was composed. It should be sung while the student-band
of artists stood around, each holding the
flower-wreathed goblet from which he might quaff
in silence, while his heart-memories were wandering
back to fatherland. Let me sing,’—she paused on
seeing the deep melancholy depicted on her husband’s
countenance—‘nay, forgive me for jesting, love, I
know with whom are your thoughts to-night, and will
not ask you to listen to a lighter strain.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A month went by winged with love and hope.
Paul found himself growing weaker, but he looked
forward to a sea-voyage as a sure means of restoring
him to health. Carlotta was hastening her preparatory
arrangements, willing to leave her home,
willing to brave the perils of the deep, in the belief
that old Ocean’s life-inspiring wave would prove the
fabled fountain of youth to her beloved. She had
never seen consumption in any of its varied and
sometimes beautiful forms. She knew not that the
eye could retain its lustre, that the cheek could glow
with more than its usual brightness, that the heart
could be lured by a false hope, until, like a red leaf
of the forest, dropping suddenly from the topmost
bough, the doomed one fell, stricken down in an
unthought of moment by the stern destroyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One morning, when Paul had remained much
longer than usual in his apartment, Carlotta sought
him for the purpose of whiling him abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was lying asleep on a couch, where he must
have thrown himself from very weariness, as one of
the brushes with which he had been painting had
fallen from his hand upon the floor. His wife softly
approached. She stooped and kissed his lips. He
opened his eyes, smiled lovingly upon her, and
pointed to the picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘You have made me too beautiful, dearest; this
must be a copy of the image in your heart.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Ah, I have not done you justice, you are far
more lovely, my own wife, yes, far more lovely—my
mother—my mother—’ repeated Paul, dreamily.
It was evident his thoughts were wandering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘You are exhausted, dear love; but sleep now,
and I will watch beside you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carlotta knelt down and laid her cheek on his.
Afraid of disturbing him, some minutes elapsed ere
she again raised her head and turned to look upon
the sleeper. She took the hand that hung listlessly
by his side. It was cold, and she thought to warm it
by pressing it to her lips—to her cheek—to her heart.
She bent her ear close to the sleeper—there was no
sound; she laid her lips on his—oh, God! where was
the warm breath? A horrible dread came over her,
and unable from the intensity of her agony to utter any
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
cry, she sunk down and gazed fixedly in her husband’s

<p class='pindent'>“And thus were they found by her father, who
was the first to enter the apartment. Paul quite
dead—Carlotta lying to all appearance lifeless at his
side—and before them the unfinished picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the fond wife was restored to consciousness,
and felt the full weight of that misery that was
crushing out her young life, her reason became unsettled.
It was very sad to see her wandering from
room to room as if in search of some lost object,
often stopping to unfold, and then folding again, the
garments prepared for their journey. She would
frequently rise with a sudden start, walk hurriedly
to the window, and stand for a long time in an attitude
of fixed attention, then mournfully shaking her
head to and fro, would slowly resume her accustomed
seat, and in a low voice repeat ‘not yet—not yet—Paul
still lingers in Rome.’ Carlotta remained in
this melancholy state during the time I was in
Florence, but a letter received since my return home
informs me that after a short interval, in which
reason resumed her sway, the sufferer calmly departed,
coupling the name of her beloved with the
rest and the bliss of Paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wretched father was filled with self-upbraidings.
But for him, he said, Paul Talbot might have
been living, and his daughter living, happy in each
other’s love. He spoke truly. To gratify his ambition,
Paul had overtasked the powers of life. The
frail shrine was consumed by the flame which for
years had been scorching and burning into the heart
and soul of the artist. Too late had he obtained his
reward. Too late had Carlotta’s father consented to
her union with Paul. Too late had the old man
found that by his daughter’s alliance with a man of
genius, a greater lustre would have shone upon his
house than could ever be reflected from his glittering
hoard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here ended my friend’s narration, and while with
him I lamented the fate of genius, I could not forbear
blaming the conduct of the wealthy Florentine. Nor
could I help thinking, that too often the golden ears
betray the ass, while wisdom, virtue, talent, constitute
the only real greatness.</p>

<p class='line'>So from one failing step we come to tread</p>

<p class='line'>So, from the blue sky shining overhead,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of
those that bring glad tidings,” is the language of
elder Scripture, and how often has the heart of man
responded to the truth of the declaration, as the eye
has caught the earnest smile and noted the lightness
of feet that distinguish the bearer of pleasing intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great poet of nature hath, in the spirit of the
above comment, remarked that the bearer of unwelcome
news has “but a losing office.” And thousands
of those who have been messengers of good
to the great, the wealth-possessing and honor-conferring
among men, have found themselves ennobled
and sometimes enriched, for the simple narrative
of an event in which they had no share, and of which
they knew little more than the report which they had
received from others and delivered where it was
greatly desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know that the text of Scripture which we
have placed at the beginning of these remarks has
allusion to tidings of greater joy, of more gladness,
than all the bulletins of battles and statements of victories
which the hastened dispatch bearer has ever
conveyed to the awaiting monarch—more lovely
and more desired than messages of love and tokens of
reciprocation which the herald of man’s affection and
woman’s deep, late-told love ever conveyed. The
triumph of the conqueror of armies must be short
and partial—the love of the most devoted perishes, at
least with the object, if it is not quenched by its own
fitful sallies. But the glad tidings which hasten and
beautify the feet of those who come over the mountain
of our offences is of life-long endurance, and
enters into the eternity for which it prepares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a picture in this number of the Magazine
to which we are alluding, and to which we mean to
refer when we talk of messengers of glad tidings.
We know that the common reader will look at the
title, and, if he recollects the narrative, he will be
startled at the idea of “glad tidings,” when sorrow
and tears were on the face of the messenger, bodings
of terrible afflictions were in his mind, and their
nearness was being foretold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are these glad tidings? Do such messages make
beautiful the bearer? Can we rejoice at the overwhelming
evil that is to befall the “City of Peace,”
and sweep away the temple of the Most High, and
give to famine, to violence, to dishonor and to death
the sons and the daughters of the people of God?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if these evils were the consequences of crimes,
if the destroyer were but an instrument in the hand
of omnipotent love to waste the destroyed, and to
be himself the object of a similar wrath, that the
“peace” which the great messenger was to bring
on earth might have an abiding place, in consequence
of the terrible things which he only foretold—surely
the feet of such an one are beautiful. He <span class='it'>brings</span>
salvation, while he only <span class='it'>foretells</span> destruction; he
makes the wrath of man, which he prophecies, the
instrument to produce that love and peace of which
he is the real author.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>There had been much confusion in the city in consequence
of reports brought to the principal ecclesiastical
and civic officers, of the unusual proceedings
of citizens at a short distance beyond the place,
where palm branches had been strewn in the highway,
and garments spread out, upon which the hoofs
of the rider’s animal were to tread—tokens of remarkable
respect, which seemed to look treasonable
to the foreign power, that directed the political
affairs, and to the native priests who directed the
spiritual concerns—the forum and the temple were
agitated; the viceroy and the high-priest each
started at such evidences of neglect of fealty.
Rome and Jerusalem both felt that there was an antagonistic
power operating, if not directly against,
at least incidentally hostile to them; and Rome and
Jerusalem—the conqueror and the conquered—joined
in efforts to suppress the evil. Each would have
crushed the power of the other, but both would unite
to repel a power that was hostile to both. Each
would have bruised the mailed arm of the other, but
both trembled at what would have healed the breast
of each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been a scene of triumph—but He who
had been the object of the huzzas of the multitude
that thronged his way with tokens of obedience—<span class='it'>head</span>
obedience, with little of <span class='it'>heart</span> in the offering—he
had sat unmoved by outward demonstration of feeling
for the acclamations of those who thronged his
path. Another mission was his—another triumph
was desired—another evidence of popular feeling
was to be experienced, and in a little time he separated
from the multitude, and ascending the mount,
at whose base he had stood, he sat down with the
four or five that were with him, and gazed abroad
upon the outstretched scene below them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful evening. Behind them the dust
which had not yet subsided since the people had
thronged the roads with songs of triumph, was reflecting
the light of the declining sun. Beneath them
was the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the terrible seat of
<span class='it'>judgment</span> and dread; and beyond was the beloved
city, stretched out in the repose of the evening sun,
which was reflected by numerous gorgeous domes;
and the busy hum of business came up to the quiet
summit of Olivet, as if to bear to those who rested
here the story of man’s heedlessness of his life’s
great end.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
They were Jews that thus looked out, the leader
and the followers, Hebrews of Hebrews, and they
loved the land of their birth and the city of their nation’s
boast. Every affection of the human heart was
enlisted for the beautiful towns and sacred edifices,
and all the outspread loveliness of the country’s hills
and valleys; and as the sun seemed to pour surpassing
splendor upon the place, and as youth and beauty
went forth to seek their pleasures, and age toiled upward
toward the temple for the evening sacrifice,
and all that was seen, and all that the heart suggested,
appealed to the patriotic affection of the four—they
looked to see whether the loveliness of the scene
would not light up an unwonted smile upon the face
of their Master, who was looking intently upon the
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no smile. The deep thought that
rested on his brow, and the tear that glistened in his
eye, showed that the past and the future were with
him. That all the blessings which had been pronounced
upon Jerusalem, and all the promises made
in her behalf, all the sins which she had committed,
and which God had pardoned, and all the negligence
against which she had been warned, and for which
pardon had been presented; all her thoughtlessness
now, and all the uncomprehended miseries which
were in her path, were in one group in his mind—and
the sound of the destroyer and the desolation of
the conquered stood before him—the famine that
wasted the people and the fire that destroyed the
temple were there, and as he remembered how He
would have sheltered them from the consequences
of their own follies, and how they despised his love;
how he would have shielded and comforted the sons
and daughters of that city of his love, but they refused,
<span class='it'>He wept</span>—wept human tears—wept tears of
earthly fondness, that came bursting up from his
heart—deep agony marked his face when gathering
the recollection of all the promises which had accompanied
their probation, the glories by which they
had been invited to goodness—he exclaimed, “But
now they are forever hidden from thine eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a mission was that the Master assumed—what
an experience was that of his intimate followers.
The many listened to his heavenly doctrine and
love—many were astonished at the miracles that
marked his public ministry, that made the temple
and the wayside <span class='it'>clinics</span> where his divine skill was
exhibited, and drew the people from their synagogues
and altars, to offer at the street corners the sacrifice
of enlightened hearts and the homage of soul admiration.
But these, the favored few, the elders and
chosen ones of his little flock stood with him in the
terrible moments, when the office of his mission was
not exercised on others, but came to be ministered on
himself—three of them witnessed the tears at the
grave of a friend—they saw with trembling awe the
glory of his transfiguration with Moses and Elias—and
now these stood there solemn, trembling witnesses
of an agony of affliction that wrung tears for
others from Him who could look down upon the
garden that was to be the scene of a trial which
human eyes could not witness and live—who could
look forward to the hall of infamy that was to witness
his mockery, to the winding way of sorrow
in which he was to bear his cross, and upward to
the eminence where the work was to be consummated.
The tears were not for himself. He wept
for the misery of those who should procure the agonizing
passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artist has chosen this moment for his picture.
It was a bold thought—but it was a good one—what
the pen records may not the pencil illustrate, and is
not the lesson of that most instructive hour brought
closer home to the heart by the representation of the
scene which the sacred historian describes? How
well the artist has executed his task is not for us to
say. Indeed such a picture is in its conception so
full of suggestion, that we may safely leave to the
painter’s professional pride the finishing of his work
according to the canons of his art. The moment
that we recognize the subject, the moment we catch
the time, the place and the office, we lose sight of
all that the pen has written or the pencil attempted
to delineate, and acknowledge that our hearts, our
fancy have taken hold of all and borne us back to
the awful hour—we do not pause to look at features
or position on the canvas, but at once we kneel in
imagination at a distance from the consecrated group,
and as Olivet and Sinai and Calvary meet the eye,
and the temple gleams in the light of the setting sun,
we inquire what is the thought, the high, mighty
thought that swells upward in the heart of the Master
there? Alas! who shall know? Who could conceive?
Eternities are in his mind, and all the vast
concerns of angels and of men are before him; and
yet for one city, one erring city, one little spot upon
the great map of the universe, he fixes his eyes, and
over its fate he weeps tears of earthly sorrow—weeps
not that one stone of the temple shall not be
left upon the other—weeps not that all the monuments
of his nation’s glory shall be wasted, and that
the ploughshare of the infidel shall upturn the sacred
soil. Not for these did he weep—but that those children
of the Father, whom he “would have gathered
as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,”
should be destroyed by the sword, and the virtue of
the daughters of his people should be the derision
and spoil of the conqueror. They were human tears—but
divine sympathies!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in that scene of wounded love, when the
foreseeing, or the foredwelling of his higher nature
made the <span class='it'>present</span> of his human exposure terrible—in
that hour of sympathy and sorrow, the favored and
the <span class='it'>intimate</span> were his companions. Theirs was not
yet the gift of foreknowledge—they lived only in the
present, and knew only of the past. Little indeed
could they comprehend the agony of the Master, as
they could not foresee the cause. Their highest gift
was <span class='it'>faith</span>—they could believe—they could confide—they
could listen with silent assurance—and however
contradictory might appear the words of the
Teacher and the circumstances of the times, they had
learned from rebukes and experience to trust to the
former. And as they follow with their eyes the
mournful bend of the Master’s gaze, as they melted
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
before the weeping of the sinless and loving, they
bowed in meek assent to the terrible <span class='it'>anathema</span> foretold,
and, not being authorized to give, or to proclaim
it, they meekly sighed the <span class='it'>maranatha</span>, and
left the work to God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You see some of the multitude pressing up <span class='it'>toward</span>
the Master, but not <span class='it'>upon</span> him. You see, too, in the
distance, woman with her face set toward Him to
whom her heart is given. Woman following but
not approaching. The first evidence of personal
suffering would have brought her to his side—the
first chance of offering homage would have taken
her to his feet. It is woman, too, in her beautiful office—her
heart is with the Master—it is good for her to
stand where she may be called. He may not indeed
speak to her, but virtue might go forth from him and
bless her—and so she had brought with her a little
child. It seemed not meet to her that she should
seek Jesus and her child not be led to him. She had
indeed heard the Master say, in regard to some others,
“suffer little children to come unto me,” and how did
she know, standing afar off though she might be—standing
in awe and reverence—how did she know
but when his moment of bitter sorrow had passed
away, the Master might turn and smile on her—and
take her little child in his arms and bless him—so
had he done to others—and so she was willing to
await, willing to stand and see what the Lord
would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the immediate scene of tears and solemn
wailing woman is not found. Where are those that
followed his steps? Where are those who ministered
to his wants? Alas! the scene was not for such
hearts. It was the last sacrifice of national feeling;
humanity acknowledges the claim—for mental mortal
agony at events to come there was no consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was for woman to make beautiful her mission by
her implicit faith; it was for woman to minister to his
<span class='it'>physical</span> wants; her humility would find a delightful
office when she bathed his feet with her tears, and her
faith had comforting expression when she wiped
them with the hairs of her head. Woman’s care
provided the household comforts which humanity
needed, and woman’s piety sat self-abased, yet
gathered strength at the Master’s feet as he opened
the oracles of truth. Woman wept for him as he
bore his cross upward to Calvary; and woman lingered
at the foot of that cross when others had fled;
and it was woman that came earliest to kneel at the
sepulchre. Where service was to be performed,
where faith was to be tried, where physical wants
were to be supplied, and physical suffering assuaged,
there woman was to be found. But where the agony
of mental passion was to be endured; where the
unspeakable and the incomprehensible were to be
exhibited, woman was not. Her mission of faith
and love required no such exercise, her feelings demanded
no such purification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have done. The picture which we give is
suggestive, and we hope that it will suggest more to
others than we have been able to express; because to
such a scene as the artist represents, when the heart
or fancy enters it is lost in amazement. A thousand
thoughts crowd, less for utterance than for existence,
and we feel that when there is more than earthly
love, more than earthly interest, the idea must be
more than human, and expression will be infinitely
short of the conception.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. LYDIA JANE PEIRSON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grenada had fallen. The miserable remnant of a
once powerful nation, driven from the cities of their
glorious empire, hunted by an untiring zeal to destroy,
crowded at length into their chief stronghold,
the city of their regal power—the birth-place and the
sepulchre of a long race of puissant monarchs—had
endured all the miseries of siege, of famine, and of
slaughter; had endured with an invincible determination
to die rather than yield; and they had died
by the sword, by hunger and thirst, by despair, by
pestilence; and their rich and magnificent city had
been sacked, plundered, ravaged, made the prey of
soldiers, greedy for spoil, thirsting for the blood of
an infidel foe, exasperated by resistance, and maddened
by fanatical zeal. Grenada had fallen; the
Moors were no longer a nation of the earth. Ferdinand
and Isabella, weary of war, and satiated with
conquest, were reposing in state at Santa Fe, or San
Felipe, with every demonstration of triumph, every
show of thanksgiving to the God of battles. The
days were divided between the most gloriously marshaled
tournaments and the most magnificent religious
processions; the nights were devoted to the
masquerade and the mass; the whole world seemed
vocal, now with strains of triumphant martial music,
now with the no less lofty Te Deum, or Gloria in Excelsis.
All was joy and gladness, triumph and gratitude.
The temporary palace was shining like the
fabled palace of Aladdin, builded of the gold and
gems of the genii world. In all the apartments the
magic of regal magnificence was displayed in the
taste of the most approved style of art. Tapestries
of regal blue and Tyrian purple, broidered and
fringed with scarlet, green and gold, in the inimitable
style of the artists of Babylon, swept from the lofty
ceilings to the velvety carpels of the marble pavements
which were rich with tufted work of flowers
of every hue, while in the recesses of the windows,
where the tapestries were looped aside with cords
of the richest dyed and braided silks, entwined with
strings of glittering gems, and heavy with tassels of
feathery silk and drops of gold and diamonds, were
placed beautifully enameled vases of the porcelain
of Italia, supporting branches of artificial flowers and
fruits of immense value. From the daisy, with its
petals of pearl and eye of platted gold, to the rose of
Damascus, formed of flashing rubies, and dewed with
purest diamonds; from the rich clusters of grapes of
amethyst, to the golden pear and nectarine, beryl
and sardonix. Doors opened upon seemingly interminable
vistas of trees and flowering shrubs, intermingled
with candelabras of gold, wrought into the
semblance of tall plants, bearing flowers of crystal
and purest porcelain of every delicate tint, each of
which was a lamp, burning perfumed oil, and giving
out rich fragrance with its mellowed light; while
birds of every clime, from the stately pea-fowl to
the minutest lady-bird, admirably imitated in enameled
gold and precious stones, were fixed upon elastic
sprays, swaying to every breath, and chirping forth
melody from little organs, played upon by their own
tremulous motions, and so perfect was the workmanship
that their forms and notes were hardly to
be distinguished from those of the real birds that
walked or flew amongst them in the gay parterres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amid all this enchantment moved groups of richly
habited men and women; dons and cavaliers, in their
blazing military costumes, and dark-eyed donnas, in
soft silks, rich velvets, and transparent muslins of
India, ornamented with brilliants, plumes, or flowers,
each as her fancy dictated. Some were dancing to
lively music, some listening to soft melodies and
songs of love; some were grouped around the beautifully
imitated trees, on which ripe fruits of every
clime seemed to hang in nature’s wild profusion;
some clustered around statues, which presented baskets
and trays of the choicest viands; others again
rested beside fountains which threw up jets of perfumed
wine, which, as it descended in drops, displayed
rainbows of inimitable splendor, painted by
colored lights arranged for the purpose, while here
and there a youthful couple, walking apart, and apparently
unconscious of all the surrounding splendor,
betrayed the tender topic of their sweet communings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could discontent and heaviness of heart exist
amid all this wealth and splendor and apparent happiness?
or do all these fail to satisfy the yearnings of
the immortal mind? In a retired part of the gardens,
where a few dark evergreens clustered over a natural
spring of living water, stood a man apparently
forty years of age, plainly habited in rich black
velvet, which displayed to the best advantage a form
of manly mould and exquisite symmetry. His
beaver lay beside him on the turf, and his noble head
thus exposed, displayed the perfection of nature’s
statuary. His high and expansive forehead, strongly
marked and delicately moulded features, dark,
piercing and restless eyes, bespoke genius to conceive,
energy to prosecute, perseverance to complete
achievement of lofty daring. But there was an expression
of melancholy around his perfect mouth,
and his dark brows had acquired a contraction which
proved that he was familiar with disappointment,
and the contumely of inferior souls. Wrapped in
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
deep thought he seemed, except that from time to
time, as he lifted his eyes and glanced up the vista,
there flashed from their dark depths the impatience
of a mighty spirit, baffled of its aim, chained in its
flight, and misunderstood in the darkness of surrounding
ignorance. A figure, elastic with the buoyancy
of joy, advanced toward him, a warm hand clasped
his, and a glad voice exclaimed, “Courage, my
friend, she has consented to see you, to listen to
your plea, to weigh your arguments, and decide
upon your claims to patronage. Courage, I say, for
if she listen to you, she will espouse your cause.”
A light, intense, but momentary, flashed over the
face of the dark-browed man, as he pressed the hand
of his messenger, exclaiming, “Thank you—to me
you are, indeed, San Angel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the gay groups disappeared from the
scene of magnificent enchantment; the lights went
out one by one, like stars at the approach of day;
the voices of melody ceased amongst the pavilions,
and in the echoing halls, and silence seemed resuming
her natural empire over the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a retired apartment of the royal palace sat
Isabella of Castile, with her two young daughters.
The beauty of the queen was of a style to command
respect rather than admiration, obedience rather
than love. Majesty was in her form and mien,
pride sat on her brow, and in her tones and gestures
lived an authority which none dared question or disobey.
Well was it for herself and those around her
that she was governed by the nicest principles of
honor; that her whole life was swayed by the most
fervent and conscientious devotional feelings; so
that as a queen, as a wife, and as a mother, she was
above reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eldest daughter, the Lady Isabella, inherited
with her mother’s name, a large portion of her personal
and mental qualities; but while one was a woman
and a queen, the other was a young princess,
proud, impatient of control or contradiction, and
delighting in magnificence and admiration. Her
younger sister, the Lady Joanna, though she had a
fine form and regular features, with the dark, languid
eyes of her country, was destitute of that grace and
vivacity which is the great charm in woman’s character.
The warm blood never gave a living glow
to the dark olive of her complexion, and it was seldom
that the deep fringes of her eyelids were lifted
sufficiently to allow those with whom she conversed
to mark the beautiful and flitting shadows of the
deep and sweet emotions of her loving spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother!” cried the young Isabella, her whole
person radiant with the spirit’s light, “oh, mother,
what a glorious thing it is to be a queen’s daughter;
to live in such magnificence, to be an object of admiration
and worship, to listen while gay and noble
cavaliers extol one’s beauty and accomplishments;
but, mother, it is my highest glory that I am <span class='it'>your</span>
child, your namesake, and like you in mind and
person. Oh, how my heart swelled last night as I
heard men speak of the truly royal Isabella of Castile.
But, mother, I am not quite as noble-souled as you,
for I heard them tell that in your girlhood, when the
discontented nobles and people would have placed
you on your brother’s throne, you utterly refused to
consent to his being deposed, and only allowed yourself
to be declared his successor. I could not have
been so moderate; oh, I long to be a queen like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A queen!” murmured Joanna, who occupied a
cushion at her mother’s feet, “a queen,” and her
voice was low and sweet as the murmur of a guitar,
when its strings are moved by the orange-scented
breeze alone. “I would be queen of one loving
heart alone. I ask no kingdom beyond a quiet home,
with one to love me, dearly, truly, unchangingly, as
I could love again. Oh, mother, I am weary of all
this noise and show; my heart grows sick, as I mark
these glorious things, and feel that they are spoils of
war, relics of a fallen power, trophies of a victory
achieved by bloodshed, fire, famine, and pestilence.
Do not frown, dear mother, my queen; but I cannot
help thinking of the loving hearts, and beautiful women,
and tender babes that perished in Grenada.
They were infidels, but they had human hearts; they
loved, and were beloved, and, oh, what bitter sundering
of holy ties was in that devoted city. I cannot
rejoice in such dreadful victory; I dare not thank our
merciful Father in Heaven that he has permitted our
armies to inflict such a vast amount of misery, not
only on our armed foes, but on their helpless and
innocent families.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The queen’s countenance was troubled; she regarded
her daughters alternately. “Alas! my children,”
she said at length, “I foresee unhappiness for
you both. Isabella’s spirit will never be satisfied
with power and grandeur; and your heart, Joanna,
will never be filled with the love for which alone it
asks. It is possible to be beautiful, honored, and a
mighty queen, and yet be very miserable—oh, very
miserable! Leave me now, my children, for the
hour of audience is at hand; and I am to listen to a
strange suitor and weigh a mighty project.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queen Isabella sat in her private audience-chamber,
surrounded by her nobles. There was a shadow on
her brow deeper than the shade of business cares;
and it was remarked by her counsellors that every
article of the spoils of the fallen Moors had been removed
from her apartments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently San Angel and his friend, Columbus,
were ushered to the royal presence. The great adventurer
wore the same plain habit of black velvet,
but appeared infinitely more noble in that dress than
did any of the embroidery-decked cavaliers in the
royal presence. Columbus was no stranger to courts
and princes, yet as he bent his knee before Isabella
of Castile, he felt to pay her the homage of the soul,
and she thought that she had never until then looked
upon true greatness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise,” she said, “and speak what you have to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood before her calm, collected, and with the
air of a man having full confidence in himself; and
his speech, which at first was hesitating and low,
soon flowed in a torrent of strong eloquence, betraying
the tide of the deep spirit which thus poured out
its speculative treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
“Madam,” he said, “you behold me, a native of
Genoa, a suitor to your majesty for aid, not to prosecute
an idle enterprise to attain for myself gay
baubles, or the yellow gold that lies like a heavy
chain upon the souls of its votaries, but to prosecute
a great and glorious enterprise, of the success of
which I am morally certain, and which will be an
inestimable benefit to the whole world, and add, if it
be possible, new honors to the name of Isabella of
Castile. Madam, the teachings of science, as well
as my apprehension of the goodness and wisdom of
our bountiful Creator, have led me to a firm conviction
that all the unexplored surface of this vast globe
is not, cannot be, a barren waste of waters. I know
that there are vast islands, probably a great continent,
sufficient to balance the lands that now compose the
world, lying away in the western ocean. These
unknown lands I would discover and explore. Or
even if such do not exist, as we know that the earth
is globular in form, I shall at least discover a passage
to India through the western ocean, and so add a
glory to the crown of Castile which shall eclipse the
lustre which recent navigators have given to Portugal.
This is the age of naval enterprise and great discoveries;
let the most important exploit of this age
live with the name of Queen Isabella on the historic
page forever and forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, I know that I am no idle dreamer, no
speculative theorist; I seek to confirm by actual discovery
the truths which reason and religion proclaim
to my mind as indisputable. And yet I have found
no soul capable of understanding mine; no rich
prince or noble willing to risk a few thousands for
an incalculable benefit to the whole world through all
the years to come, and a fame which shall live until
the sun burns out in the great temple of the blue ether.
You will ask why I, a citizen of Genoa, a rich and
powerful state, find it necessary to solicit the aid of
foreign powers. I have said I find no souls capable
of understanding mine. The great ones of my dear
native city have pronounced me a framer of illusive
theories. I would have won for her an imperishable
honor; she would not receive it at my hand. Filled
with sorrow and indignation, I then turned toward
Portugal, encouraged by her recently acquired reputation
as a patron of adventurous navigators. Her
great ones listened to my suit, amused with hopes,
and delayed to give me a definite answer; and while
I waited and strove to convince them of the rationality
of my speculations, they treacherously drew
from me all my grounds of belief in the existence of
another continent, my intended method of discovery,
with the direction I meant to steer, and all the information
I could give concerning my projected voyage;
and, indeed, madam, you will find it hard to believe
such infamy, they fitted out a fleet secretly, which
sailed, failed of its object, encountered storms, and returned,
asserting that they had done all that navigators
could do, and that my theory is false and futile. Thus
I have been cheated out of three years of my existence,
while my ardent soul is burning out its habitation.
Then I thought of England. I sent my brother to lay
my project before her royal Henry. Years have
passed, and yet he has not returned. Madam, I know
that the lands of which I have spoken do exist. I
know that I am able to search them out in the world
of dark waters which has wrapped them from our
knowledge since the world began. I know that I
can reach them, for God has raised me up and endowed
me as his instrument to affect these great discoveries,
and he will preserve my life, and guide me
by his almighty power. I have petitioned your
august consort, but he is occupied by other matters, or
swayed by those who would prevent me from achieving
that which they dare not undertake themselves,
who would withhold from me the honors which they
have not courage and ability to achieve for themselves.
On you, therefore, illustrious madam, now
rest my ardent hopes. Surely amid all this magnificence,
the small sum necessary for my outfit
would not be felt. And in the event of my success,
which I deem certain, would not the vast and rich
territory thus added to the dominions of Castile and
Aragon, bring millions of revenue for every hundred
expended on my expedition. I beseech your highness,
listen to my plea; I am like a strong eagle,
longing to scale the pinnacle of a lofty mountain, but
bound by a heavy chain in a dark and miry valley, I
am wearing out my life in a vain effort to spread my
shackled pinions to the glorious sunlight. Let your
royal bounty remove these shackles, give me the
means, and say to me go, explore the ocean, discover
new worlds, and take possession in the name of
Isabella, the illustrious queen of Castile. Let me go,
in pity to my restless spirit. Let me go and win
everlasting honors for myself and the age, and for
my royal patroness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queen Isabella had listened with evident interest,
her dark eyes flashed, and her cheeks burned with
excitement. She extended her beautiful hand to the
suppliant. “I grant your prayer,” she said; “I will
furnish funds for your voyage. This display of magnificence
is not at my command. It belongs to our
nobles, our churches, our officers and soldiers. You
behold here the spoils of the vanquished, which must
reward the vanquishers. It is possible to be poor in
the midst of regal splendor. But I have jewels which
are at my own disposal, which add nothing to my
power or my happiness. I will dispose of them, and
give you the means to prosecute your project to discover
new worlds amid the wilderness of waves, and
win that undying fame which you deem within your
reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Low on his knees fell the joyful adventurer, and
poured out his gratitude in few but forceful words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looks of scorn, contempt, and bitter enmity were
fixed upon the adventurous Genoese by the courtiers
who surrounded her majesty, and it was evident that
her presence alone restrained them from openly expressing
their hatred of him, and disapproval of her
decision. One cavalier in particular ground his teeth
with rage, and muttered his vow of eternal enmity to
him whose soul so overreached all human intellect
had heretofore achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Isabella’s royal word was pledged, and her
powerful eloquence had won her regal Ferdinand of
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
Aragon to espouse the cause of Columbus, and associate
his name with hers in patronage of his great
adventure. But the man of mighty soul had departed
on his limitless voyage, and his scoffers continued to
clamor against him, and predict the utter failure of
his project, and destruction of his fleet and crews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ferdinand and Isabella were holding their court in
Barcelona, when a courier arrived with intelligence
that Columbus with his fleet had made the harbor of
Palos, from which he sailed about ten months previous.
Various rumors followed the announcement,
rumors of glory, and gold, and territories, rich and
blooming as the garden of Eden. Then gushed in
clamorous torrents the bitter waters of envy, hatred,
and detraction; but Isabella heeded not their clamors,
but awaited with hope and exultation the arrival of
her protégé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length a triumphant train approached the city.
Loud shouts swelled up to heaven from the excited
multitudes; the city poured out her torrents of living
creatures to meet the mighty man who had wrested
a world from the untraversed ocean floods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monarchs, in their most glorious apparel, sat
upon their throne in the magnificently furnished reception
hall of their palace home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The procession approached; a herald announced
the great discoverer. He entered the presence, and
the monarchs arose and stood to greet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With him came natives of his new world, with
their strange features and unheard of complexions—habited
in the grotesque costume of their native
clime. In beautiful caskets and vases were borne
gold, unwrought, and fashioned into curious ornaments,
fruits and flowering plants, and strangely beautiful
specimens of verdure and foliage, with articles
of the manufacture of those far-off lands—all things
strange to the admiring beholders, and different from
aught that the eastern continent produced. All was
wonder, admiration and delight, except in the black
habitations of envy and murderous hate. But Columbus
had achieved his triumph—he had discovered
a new world; he had triumphed over the malice of
his enemies, he had won for himself an imperishable
fame; but he laid all his glories at the feet of his royal
patroness, <span class='sc'>Isabella of Castile</span>, without whose
aid the mighty soul of enterprise would have worn
itself out in vain endeavors to spread its glorious
pinions. Oh, that every mighty mind could find an
Isabella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ought not the name of Isabella to be forever associated
with that of Columbus, as without her aid he
could never have crossed the Atlantic? Should not
the honor of the discovery of the western world rest
alike upon him who conceived, and her who enabled
him to execute the mighty project? And yet the
fame of Columbus is wide as the world, and eternal
as the lands to which he opened the way across the
billows; while she who gave wings to his genius and
power to his arm is almost forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I would wed her name to his forever by
christening this great and hitherto nameless republic,
by the appropriate and euphonious title of Columbella.
Thus would I give honor to whom honor
is due.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had almost forgotten to speak of another class,
important though youthful, of the saucy, petted and
spoiled <span class='it'>pages</span>. They, too, are gone, and not one of
them survived the eighteenth century. The Almanac
of the Empire, it is true, bears the names of thirty-two
pages, and that of the restoration of seventy-two;

who really was what he professed to be, and who

<p class='pindent'>The old Duke of Lauraguais said that the first
English frock worn in France had been the death-blow
of the French nobility, one of the most numerous
of the grades of which had been the first to
adopt it. The Marquises, with their proverbial love
of change, began from that time to transform their
<span class='it'>modes</span>, and effected it so rapidly that their brocade
garments were soon only found on the stage, or in
the <span class='it'>bals-costumés</span>. This frock, (fr. froc,) which had
so disadvantageous an influence, was a kind of
loose gown, with pockets on the inside, and without
any tightness at the waist. It was cut lengthwise
with the cloth, and though first without a collar, ultimately
acquired one. The dress of the age in other
respects remained long unaltered, though its accessories,
such as buttons, plaits, <span class='it'>etc.</span>, were constantly
changing. The coats first were made to button all
the way up, and then only from the pockets up:
finally buttons were not used at all. After some
lapse of time loops were used, which clasped the
narrow coat over the often portly <span class='it'>tournure</span> in the
most ridiculous manner. Waistcoats then were
waistcoats, not <span class='it'>gilets</span>, but substantial coats without
sleeves. The wardrobe of a gentleman also contained
another garment called a <span class='it'>veston</span>, covered with
lace and <span class='it'>broderie</span>, a <span class='it'>volant</span>, which was always single-breasted,
various kinds of redingotes, such as the
<span class='it'>roquelaure</span>, the <span class='it'>houppelande</span>, etc., all of which were
made of every conceivable material and color. The
above are the general characteristics of costume, all
the variations of which we cannot be expected to describe
any more than the botanist is to count every
leaf on a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Black, now the <span class='it'>ne plus ultra</span> of dress, was then
worn only by <span class='it'>procureurs</span>, authors, small landholders,
and, in a word, all persons who were negligent in
their toilette. It was the index of restricted means,
and of mourning, when the most obscure bourgeois
dressed himself like a count or marquis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The greatest variety of colors were worn, and contrasts
which now would seem most repulsive were
every day met with. A scarlet velvet coat, with
a black collar and steel buttons, sulphur-colored
breeches and blue-striped hose were considered in
very good taste about 1785. <span class='it'>Boue de Paris</span> (brick-dust
color) and London smoke were worn in both
London and Paris in 1786, and in 1788, a color
known by the repulsive name of beef' s-blood was the
extremity of fashion. Waistcoats had all kinds of
names, taken from operas, such as Figaro, Cœur-de-Lion,
etc. Handkerchiefs <span class='it'>aux adieux de Fontainebleu</span>
were worn; neither of these, however, seem to
have differed materially from other waistcoats and
handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the age of <span class='it'>cravats</span>, made of fine lawn or
baptiste richly laced, with hanging ends; peruques <span class='it'>à
la Grecque</span>, with three buckles; the sword and plumed
hat. Some persons also wore the stockinet breeches,
by the side of which Adam’s fig-leaf was decent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following is a group altogether characteristic
of that age in which the redingote, the <span class='it'>coiffure à
la Grecque</span>, and plumed hat all appear:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-006.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0006' style='width:455px;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>None now can take an interest in all the mysteries
of powder and <span class='it'>coiffure</span>, with their high-sounding
names <span class='it'>à la <a id='brig'></a>Brigadière</span>, <span class='it'>à la Sartine</span>,
<span class='it'>à trois <a id='mart'></a>marteaux</span>,
etc., they are gone forever, and when the great
Leonard fled to Russia after the execution of the
king were forgotten in Paris. It will be remembered
that other capitals always copied the costumes of
the French capital, and that in speaking of Paris we
describe the costume of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grave reflections do not belong to the history of
so frivolous a thing as costume, but any one may
see that it is impossible to avoid making a comparison,
not only between the costumes, but the ideas of
the past and present. The decay of the luxury of
the old monarchy was but the forerunner of the
fall of the monarchy itself, so that rightly enough
Dumourier echoed the prophecy of its ruin, made
by an old gentleman-usher who saw the great
Roland appear before the king with shoes with
strings instead of buckles. We have brought down
the history of costume to the verge of a revolution,
all the terrors of which luxury survived, and there
may be those who think the crisis in the midst of
which France is, may pass away, and things yet a
second time resume their old state. This cannot be
the centre of fashion is destroyed, and cannot be
again created. France has more serious things to
attend to, and though all the world submitted to
French dictation, it is scarcely probable that it will
bow itself to another sceptre. France cannot resume
her sway. In 1792 the dispersed court bore
away with it all the splendor and magnificence of
the past, and left a void which the republic could not
fill. In 1830 <span class='it'>noblesse</span>, as a cast, had disappeared,
but an opulent class yet remained, who had grown
accustomed to dictate in fashion. In the year 1848
the revolution was more complete, and all have
other things to do besides thinking of periwigs and
shoe-buckles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the causes which tended in the eighteenth
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
century to modify French costume, by assimilating
all classes, we must in the first place mention the
influence of what is now called Anglo-mania. Even
as far back as Louis XV., the young nobles had become
accustomed to visit England, where they acquired
new habits if not new ideas. England for a
time was the sovereign of fashion, and hats were
worn <span class='it'>à la Tamise</span> instead of <span class='it'>à la Seine</span>. The nobles,
in imitation of the English, ruined themselves by extravagance
in horses and equipages. Quarrels arose
about the good looks of jockeys, and princes of the
blood and dukes transformed themselves into coach-drivers.
Marie Antoinette even took pride in the
dexterity with which she handled the whip and reins
of a pony-phaeton. The revolution has naturalized in
France many political phrases, but long before that
French ears and the French palate had grown used
to punch, or <span class='it'>ponche</span> as they called it, and both sexes
had become accustomed to cover up their costume
with the <span class='it'>redingote</span>, or English riding-coat. Tea
canes and hats were ultimately adopted, also from
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The revolution in England, and the round-head
ideas it evolved, had much simplified English costume,
and by the Anglo-mania this simplicity was
now reflected back on France, and continued to as
late a day as the revolution. In 1786 the English
costume was frequently seen in the streets of Paris,
and contributed in a great degree to dissipate the air
of pretension which yet animated French society.
The English boot was adopted almost universally,
and gaiters became as common as in London.
The loose locks of the English sailors were also
imitated, and this was a severe blow on the old costume,
an important portion of which was the <span class='it'>coiffure</span>.
The three-cornered cocked was replaced by
the jockey’s round hat, a ridiculous and ungainly
thing which no taste can make becoming, and no art
make comfortable. The probability, however, is
that it will become universal, and that some day all
the world will wear this head-piece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This mutual imitation continued until the adoption
of Napoleon’s Continental system, which, as is well
known, separated England from all intercourse with
Europe. When peace had put an end to the long
wars this system had occasioned, and Englishmen
again came on the Continent, their appearance struck
each other as supremely ludicrous, as the apparition
of one of our own grandfathers in the gigantic
waistcoat and the bag wig they wore would seem to
us in a modern drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before, however, an universal costume had been
adopted the revolution came. Fortunes were swept
away, palaces lost, and the people who inhabited
them dispersed. We here lose sight of powdered
hair forever, for both sexes cut their hair short, and
shoes with strings were universally adopted. The
reign of terror came, <span class='it'>sans-culottism</span> was the rage.
The red cap of liberty, the <span class='it'>houppelande</span> of red
worsted, or the <span class='it'>carmagnole</span> usurped the place of the
plumed hat and the graceful <span class='it'>roquelaure</span>. Open shirt
collars and a knotted stick, like the Irish shilelah,
were indispensible accompaniments to this dress, an
admirable representation of which is to be seen in
the making up of James Wallack, senior, for one of
his many admirable impersonations, called David
Duvigne, in that pretty two act drama of the “Hazard
of the Die.” This costume is scarcely worthy of
remark, except on account of the red Italian cap, a
garment far more graceful than our hat, but proscribed
on account of the horrors enacted by those who wore
it. It, however, never was worn except in France,
and we may well enough drop it here forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet people must not think there was no richness of
costume during the republic. There was as much
extravagance as ever, only every one dressed according
to his own whim. There were fops, too,
called <span class='it'>Muscadins incroyables</span> and <span class='it'>mervilleux</span>, who
aped the manners of the old marquis. One great
<span class='it'>trait</span> of these was they were all near-sighted, and
could not pronounce the letter R. They were the
prototypes of our own dandies, as may be seen by
the following specimen:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-007.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:300px;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This costume was imitated over all the world, and,
except in the hat, breeches and ribbons at the knee,
does not differ greatly from the dress of our own day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it!” I exclaimed, as I thrust the poker
violently into the grate, and slammed myself into an
arm-chair before the fire, “I am the most unfortunate
rascal in the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had just returned from the Hon. Mrs. Scatter’s
squeeze. I can’t imagine why it should be the case,
but it seems to be my unlucky destiny either to be
thrust or to thrust myself eternally into the most inappropriate
places possible. What the deuce should
have taken me there? I know that I have no business
at such assemblies—yet, oh, Julia!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waltzed with that fool, Fitzcrocky. The fellow
hasn’t a particle of brain, but such a <span class='it'>moustache</span>!
And then the style of his dress. With what elegant
ease he sports his habiliments! Such perfect taste in
their arrangement, and so harmonious the <span class='it'>tout ensemble</span>!
Then look at me. They were whispering.
He cast a sneering glance at my exterior. I know
she laughed at me. Zounds, I could tear my hair
to tatters!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never could dress well. If I have a handsome and
well-made coat, the vest and pants are sure to be of
the most unsuitable colors. That infernal tailor, I
verily believe, takes every advantage to make me
appear disadvantageously; and I could swear that he
palms all his unsaleable remnants upon me. Let me
see how he has figged me out for what I intended to
be the victorious campaign of this evening. Scipio,
wheel up that cheval glass. Gods and fishes! A
purple coat with silver filagree buttons—a white satin
vest—scarlet under ditto—light drab pantaloons, and
a check cravat! Black silk stockings and pumps
with rosettes. Jupiter and Moses! Why I look like
one of Bunbury’s caricatures! Tregear’s shop-window
never exhibited such a monster. No wonder
<span class='it'>they</span> laughed at me. Ha! ha! By Jove, I can’t help
laughing at myself, and it’s no joking matter, after I
had laid myself out to make a deep impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, Scipio, draw the curtains and go. Stay;
hand me the brandy-bottle and some cigars before
you make your final exit. I might as well get drunk,
and by that means bury my woes in a temporary oblivion,
despite of all temperance societies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Give me my dressing-gown, and pitch this infernal
coat out at the <a id='window'></a>window. Ha! here’s another specimen
of my undeniable taste. What man, save myself,
would ever encase himself in a brocade of a pattern
like a bed-curtain. No matter; your Persian says it
is all <span class='it'>takdeer</span>—destiny. All this, I presume, was
fore-ordained—it must have been predestined, this
atrocious, villainous piece of business, and I suppose
I can’t help it. Scipio, go to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scipio retired, and I was left alone. The night
was dark and confoundedly cold. I picked up a
volume. It was Peter Schlemihl. I lighted a cigar,
and mixing some strong brandy-and-water, I applied
myself to the business which the reader has been
previously informed I had in contemplation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all would not do. I could not succeed in my
intention. I smoked one Dos Amigos after another,
and quaffed glass after glass of Seignette. The more
I drank, in the more odious light did I appear to myself.
I ruminated upon Julia’s flirtation with Fitzcrocky.
I attempted to analyze the causes of my
abominable want of taste in the components of
costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deuce take me!” at last I cried, exhausted, and
half mad with vexation, “I wish to Heaven that I
could exchange this unlucky carcass with some more
fortunate individual, whose kinder stars may have
granted him a comelier body and a more <span class='it'>recherché</span>
taste in its decoration than my miserable self!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had I spoken these words when a gentle
cough attracted my attention. I looked up. Opposite
to me there sat a gentleman of the most prepossessing
exterior. He had drawn up a lounge to the
side of the grate, and was seated, with patient politeness,
as if in expectation of drawing my attention to
himself. He was attired in a neat and elegant suit of
black, which fitted him <span class='it'>à merveille</span>. A dark maroon
velvet vest, buttoned tightly to his chest, and falling
over into a rolling collar, displayed his linen of
superb make and texture, fastened by a small diamond
pin. His cravat was tied with a prim precision;
his boots and gloves would have driven Staub
and Walker to despair. His hat was of the most appropriate
block, and a cambric handkerchief, delicate
as the web of Arachne, and scented with <span class='it'>bouquet du
roi</span>, was occasionally applied to his nose, in the most
graceful manner. The contour of his face was perfect
Grecian, and a mass of wavy chestnut-hair was
negligently disposed over his forehead. He wore
neither whisker nor <span class='it'>moustache</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time I sat in silent amazement, wondering
how my guest had procured his <span class='it'>entreé</span>, inasmuch
as I knew that all the doors were locked and bolted,
and that my janitor had gone to bed some hour and a
half previous to the stranger’s appearance. He sat
in equal silence. Presently he arose, and pouring
out a glass of brandy, he swallowed it in a twinkling,
bowing to me with infinite gravity. He next produced
a long and slender meerschaum from his pocket,
lighted it with a <span class='it'>pastille ambreé</span> and resuming his
seat, his eyes traveled over my attire from head to
foot, with an air of well-bred curiosity. My bile
began to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask, sir,” said I, “what is the meaning of
this unusual visit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
The stranger, carelessly desisting from his investigation,
expelled a mouthful of smoke, and with a
kind of concealed chuckle, which I did not half like,
replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, sir, may I, without infringing upon propriety,
inquire of you, who <span class='it'>is</span> your tailor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My hand inadvertently sought the decanter, and I
had a vague idea of hurling it at my visiter’s head.
One moment’s reflection, together with a glance at
the well-made and sinewy form before me, determined
me to waive hostilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot imagine, sir,” I replied, with severe
dignity, “your motives in making any such inquiry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a mere trifle. I was anxious to become acquainted
with the name of your fashioner, who, to
judge from the appearance of your habiliments, must
possess a most exquisite taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, I had suspicions that my <span class='it'>amis inconnu</span>
was quizzing me. I eyed him narrowly, but
the expression of his face was that of respectful earnestness,
mingled with some curiosity. Not the
slightest trace of a quiz could be detected upon his
immovable aspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are really anxious to know,” said I, and
I confess I fell naturally gratified, for it was the first
compliment I had ever heard addressed to my taste,
“I can refer you to Cabbage &amp; Stickem, Oxford
street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could almost wish to exchange my vile taste
in costume for your more original and certainly more
refined style,” said the stranger, without moving a
single muscle of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” I cried, seizing him by the hand, “highly
as I feel flattered by such a declaration, would willingly
make such an exchange, if it were possible to
do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall find it very possible,” replied the
stranger. “Come, let us take a glass to our better
acquaintance. I am charmed to have it in my
power to confer an obligation upon a gentleman like
yourself, especially when it meets so exactly with
my own inclinations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Egad,” said I, as we hob-nobbed very cordially
together, “I am agreed to make the exchange directly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had no sooner said the word than I felt a most
violent blow at the back of my head. On my recovery,
for it almost stunned me, I was stupefied
with astonishment, upon looking up, to behold <span class='it'>myself</span>
sitting at my ease, and smoking with great
<span class='it'>insouciance</span>, upon the very seat which I had previously
occupied <span class='it'>in propria persona</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be so good, worthy sir,” said I, or the figure
I saw seated in my-arm chair, “to look in yonder
glass, and you will discover that your wishes have
been complied with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stepped to the cheval, and to my unspeakable
amazement and joy, viewed in the reflection the
person of the elegant gentleman with whom I had
exchanged exteriors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope,” said the personage who rejoiced in my
original ugliness and odious garments, “that this exchange
is entirely to your satisfaction?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could have hugged him, for I was almost beside
myself with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I thank you for your kindness,” I exclaimed,
for my old attire looked doubly ridiculous
to my new optics. “I do assure you, sir, that I am
forever at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it,” said the gentleman with a peculiar
smile, which in the plenitude of my joy I did not
notice at the time, although I recollected it afterward
perfectly well. “And now, as it grows late, I
will bid you good evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, I saw my ancient figure walk quietly
out at the door. I don’t know, but I thought I heard
him laugh a little after closing it. For my own part
I was so elated, that I could not think of going to
bed, so I sat drinking and singing, building castles in
the air, and ruminating upon the magnificent figure
which I should oppose against the fascinations of
Fitzcrocky, in the eyes of Julia. I determined, with
the afternoon of that day, to commence my triumphal
progress in her affections. In fact, I never noticed
how time slipped by, and when the entrance of some
one at the door aroused me, and I collected my scattered
senses, it was at least four hours after sunrise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gollamighty!” exclaimed the voice of Scipio.
“What de debbil we got heah? Trange man in
massa’s bed-room, and he not up yit. What you
want, eh? He some tief—some robber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you old fool,” said I, “don’t you see it’s
me—myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who me?—what dat, eh? Debbil tak me if I
no b’lieve dat he has murdered massa and teal all de
spoons! Help! murder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, you old villain!” cried I.
“Do you want to bring in the whole neighborhood?”
and seizing a candlestick, I leveled it at his woolly
pate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do <span class='it'>you</span> mean, you scoundrel, by abusing
<span class='it'>my</span> servant?” roared a voice from the bed. I looked
in that direction. There was my head protruded
from the curtains, surmounted by a red night-cap, and
a clenched fist was violently shaken at me from the
same purlieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn him out, Scipio!” I shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn him out!” repeated my <span class='it'>Eidolon</span>, if I may
so term him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn <span class='it'>who</span> out!” queried Scipio, in a state of profound
bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perfectly frantic with rage, I flew toward the bed,
eager for a pugilistic encounter, when the door was
thrown open, and my old housekeeper, with pallid
visage, peeped into the apartment. I determined to
make an appeal to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I, or am I not your master, Nancy?” said I,
in a very melancholy tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> my master! Come up, mister himperence,”
replied Nancy. “My master is in yonder bed, young
man. Run, Sip, and call a policeman. He’ll make
you know <span class='it'>your</span> master, jail-bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” thought I, “it’s all up, I see. That fellow’s
me, and I’m somebody else, but hang me if I
know who. Well, as I don’t choose to take a morning
airing at Hatton Garden, I might as well abdicate
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
at once. But,” cried I, “you scoundrel, you shall
pay for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn him out, Sip!” grunted my former voice
from the bed. How hateful it sounded! “Turn him
out, and don’t let me be disturbed till twelve. My
head aches confoundedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sneaked out of my own room like a detected
pickpocket, Nancy and Scipio attending me down
stairs, and delivering a brace of running lectures
upon the evil courses which I was pursuing, admonishing
me likewise of the certain and ignominious
end which awaits such depraved and dissolute characters
as I was presumed to be. At the foot of the
stairs, Scipio insisted upon searching me, an operation
to which, crest-fallen as I was, I did not pretend
to make the slightest opposition. I was then dismissed
in the same manner with Master Candide from
the <span class='it'>château</span> of Thonderdentronck, namely with
<span class='it'>grands coups de pied dans le <a id='derr'></a>derrière</span>, pretty well
administered by a brace of sturdy valets, whom
Scipio had summoned to his assistance from a neighboring
area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ejection from my own mansion took place
about half past nine o’clock. In the first impulses of
my rage and despair, I resolved to apply to my
friends, in order to establish my identity by their testimonies.
It was early; too early in fact to find any
of them up, and I was fain to stroll the streets until
the lingering hands of the clock should signify the
proper and canonical hour of rising. So I patrolled
Hyde Park for an hour or so, until my insides began
to give me very unequivocal tokens of their desire
for breakfast. Rage, as well as love and all other
sublunary matters, must yield to the calls of hunger.
I entered a coffee-house in Upper Brook street, and
ordered my morning meal. I drank a couple of cups
of tea, ate a French roll and a modicum of raw beefsteak,
and walked to the bar to pay my bill. I put
my hand into my pocket in search of my purse. It
was not there. I tried another, and another, and yet
another pocket. Horrid to relate, I could not meet
with the smallest coin of the realm! The waiter
began to look very black, and I could overhear the
monosyllable “<span class='it'>bilk</span>” ground out between his teeth
in a tone which indicated profound aversion and
contempt. My hair fairly stood on end. Nevertheless
I thought it best to brazen it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see, my good fellow,” said I, and I assure
you, I spoke in a very bland and courteous tone, “I
have most unaccountably forgotten my purse—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gammon!” was the very significant response of
the Ganymede. “How d’ye know you ever had
one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound your impudence, fellow!” said I, nettled
by the coolness of the query. “What d’ ye mean by
insulting a gentleman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More like a swell out o’ luck,” growled the servitor.
“Come, young ’un, this here kind of a job’s
no go. Post the cole, my boy, or it’ll be the worse
for somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As luck would have it, I thought of my diamond
breastpin, and taking that article of jewelry from my
shirt front, I offered it to the waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blast your Brummagem traps!” quoth that gentleman.
“D’ ye think I don’t know a diamond from
a Bristol stone, or gold from pinchbeck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was pinchbeck, by Jupiter!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter must have been touched by the despair
depicted upon my countenance. With a grim
smile,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, my fine chap,” said he, “if you are a bilk,
it’s plain that you’re a new hand at the trade, and I
don’t care about being too hard upon you. Give
me your wipe, and I’ll let you off for this time, but
you take care you doesn’t come the swell mob again
over this ’ere house, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart was too full for speech. I gave him my
handkerchief with a profound sigh, and throwing the
pinchbeck breastpin into the coal-scuttle, I vanished
with all convenient speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the coffee-house, I espied my crony, Dick
Buffers, across the street. To join him was but the
work of a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollo, Dick!” said I, slapping him heartily upon
the shoulder. This was the irrepressible outpouring
of a bosom, into which a ray of light, imparted by
hope, had penetrated, cheering the darksome abode
with its enlivening presence. Quickly was my joy
turned into sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, sir?” said Dick, drawing
himself up with magnificent reserve. “Do you
mean to insult me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Dick,” said I, in a sort of whimper,
for I was really becoming very much alarmed,
“don’t put a strange face on the matter. It isn’t
possible that you don’t know your old friend, Flashington
Highflyer? Why we only parted at midnight,
and dined together no later than yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Highflyer!” said Buffers. “To be sure I know
him, and very well, too. We undoubtedly did dine
together yesterday, although I cannot account for
your knowledge of the fact. But it will take even
more than your impudence to convince me that you
are the man. You must be either drunk or a fool.
Flashington Highflyer! ha! ha! Your very dress
convicts you of a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Buffers might have spared this sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my honor, Richard Buffers,” said I,
solemnly, while the tears actually stood in my eyes,
“I am that most unfortunate man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are? Why, the man’s mad! View that
looking glass in yonder shop-window, and if you
<a id='have'></a>haven’t been looking into the glass too often this
morning already, you will discover that your countenance
bears not the slightest resemblance to that of
Mr. Highflyer, that is, if you are at all acquainted
with the physiognomy of the gentleman to whose
name you have laid claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stepped to the window. One glance was sufficient.
Oh! how I cursed my super-lunatic folly, and
how I longed for my former shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Egad, it’s true,” I soliloquized. “It’s all correct,
as my Yankee friends have it. That rascal has
got into possession of my goods and chattels, as well
as of my person, and has left me nothing in return but
a most confoundedly disagreeable sense of my own
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
individuality. What a horrid piece of business to
be sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned. Dick was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who am I, then?” was my next very natural
self interrogatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was needless to disturb my remaining acquaintance
for proofs of my identity, as, indeed, if any
body had demanded of me my address, I should have
been amazingly puzzled to give it. I turned about,
entirely reckless of whither I went. Twelve, one
o’clock went by. I met many of my acquaintance,
but there was no recognition. I was in despair, and
could have sat down upon the curb-stone and wept.
My walk procured me one thing, it is true, namely,
a very good appetite; but I could have readily dispensed
with that, inasmuch as I was painfully conscious
that, without pawning my coat, I was utterly
unable to satisfy the cravings of hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours rolled on. The force of habit, I presume,
led me to Hyde Park once more. All the world was
abroad. Beauty, rank and fashion were collected in
one splendid, aristocratic mass. Carriages and four,
with servants in gorgeous liveries; every variety of
vehicle, from the dashing tandem to the humbler
carriage and pair, tilburies, buggy-wagons, and cabs
thronged and thundered around the ring. Horsemen
dashed along the carriage-ways, and pedestrians
crowded the footpaths. I sat down upon a bench
and mechanically surveyed the scene. Every well-known
face, which was wont to greet me with
smiles, but which now bestowed upon me, <span class='it'>en passant</span>,
but a vacant stare, struck a pang to my heart.
My despair would have been uncontrollable, and I
should have groveled and bit the ground with fury,
but an innate self-respect, and a desire to appear to
every possible advantage, qualities which I presume
I gained together with my once admired, but now
odiously detested figure, prevented me from making
such an exhibition, although I verily believe that I
was haunted with demoniac incitements to perform
all manner of curious antics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was now at its thickest. A chariot,
with servants in splendid liveries, which I immediately
recognized as my own, whirled onward.
Julia was seated in it by <span class='it'>myself</span>, or the devil in my
shape. There I was, perfectly plain to behold. The
face, the form were the same, but the dress superlatively
exquisite, and beautifully adapted to the figure.
The turn-out of Fitzcrocky dashed by at the same
time. He glared furiously upon my happy representative.
With matchless insinuation this latter
ogled and flirted with Julia. She returned his smiles
with eyliads of incipient affection. As they passed
me by, the fellow who had thus impudently usurped
my figure and property winked—yes, he absolutely
winked at me. My veins boiled with rage. Shrieking
out a fearful oath, I seized a fragment of paving-stone
and hurled it frantically at him. A scream, a
rush, and I turned and fled, without stopping to
ascertain the amount of damage inflicted by my missile,
and ran as if the furies had been after me. But
I ran not alone. A dense crowd of policemen, servants
and gentleman on horseback dashed in pursuit.
Never did fugitive from the galleys exert his legs
with a better will, or with more effect, than I did.
<span class='it'>Timor additit alas.</span> On I rushed, amidst the clamor,
and dust, and clatter of the yelling multitude,
as if the avenger of blood had been behind me. I
had been a sportsman, and never did a Leicestershire
fox lead a squad of Meltonians such a circumbendibus
as I did my pursuers. One by one they gave in—the
noise died away gradually, and I was safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When partially recovered, I found myself within
a queer, dark-looking old court, in the neighborhood
of Hertford street and Brick Lane. I was surrounded
by a multitude of crazy, loitering, reeking houses,
apparently the abodes of no living beings, save Jew
clothesmen, oyster venders, pawnbrokers, and gin
dealers. A squalid, miserable, broken-down dog-kennel
it was too! Tattered children ran about,
dabbling in the filthy gutters, indulging in the mockery
of play. Rough looking men, wrapped in heavy
pea-coats and coarse jackets, with red and bloated
faces, lounged about the doors of the various dealers,
and haggard, wretched-looking women might have
been descried entering the dens of the pawnbrokers,
in hopes to raise some pittance of money for the purchase
of food or liquor, by pledging paltry articles of
dress or furniture. I sat down on the pavement side
and stared around me. The scene was altogether
dissimilar to any thing I had been in the habit of witnessing,
and it was an interesting though a painful
novelty. Good God! the misery, and wretchedness,
and grinding poverty, deadening to the heart, which
exist in large cities, within ken of opulence, of
luxury and of splendor! O! could the voice of
these wretched throngs be heard, in its collected
wailing, what a cry of despairful agony would go
up to the throne of the Everlasting! Dead souls in
living sepulchres, stalking their gloomy round of
poverty, neglect and wo—uneducated, ungodly,
famine-stricken—what hope is there for them in this
world, and, word of horror, what in the next!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I sat in revery, some one tapped me on the
shoulder. I looked up. A stout, heavily built man,
with a pimpled and swollen face, attired in a rough
drab over-coat, with leather gaiters and hob-nailed
bootees, stood beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollo, gen’l’mn Bill,” quoth this interesting parsonage.
“Vy, vot brings you in these parts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew the fellow at first glance, but, by Jupiter, I
had never seen him before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, old fellow,” said I, with a hilarity that
disgusted me, although Heaven knows I couldn’t
help it, “what news from your ken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’tell thee vot,” said Gabriel Sooterkins, for the
gentleman was familiarly known by that appellation,
“a’ter this night, Billy, my bo, you had better change
your tramp. The beaks ’ave nabbed Ikey about
that ’ere job on Saffron Hill, and they say he’s
peached upon it. Confound the trade, say I, if pals
can’t be true to one another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recollected perfectly the matter he alluded to. It
was a burglary committed upon an old miser, who
had fixed his dwelling in that delicate abode, and I
very well remembered, now that Mr. Gabriel Sooterkins
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
mentioned it, that I had been the head and front
of the offending, and that Ikey and himself were accomplices
in the business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An exceedingly reputable exchange of persons I had made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said I, “if it’s done it can’t be helped,
you know, and I’m off this night,” although I had
not the most remote idea of where I was going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d a known vere you vos,” said Mr. Sooterkins,
“I’d ha’ blowed this here spot o’ work afore.
But step in here. I’ve a vord or two to say to you,
for I s’pose there’s very little dust at the bottom
of your fob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sooterkins plunged downward into a dingy
cellar, and I followed him very obediently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place into which I accompanied him was a
filthy diving, or slap-bang shop, in which retreat was
collected as motley an assemblage as the imagination
of man can conceive. A long table extended from
one end of the cellar to the other, covered with pewter
mugs and dishes, cheap crockery ware, and
knives and forks, which latter implements were
chained to the table. A very satisfactory idea of the
morals of the guests might be gathered from this circumstance;
although, indeed, if that hint had been
wanting, the variety of villany stamped upon the
faces of the profligate crew which surrounded the
table, gave proof satisfactory that they were not of
that number who rank with the honest of this world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sooterkins nodded to this amiable assembly
upon entering, and I obeyed his example, inasmuch
as I recognized among these gentlemen some very
familiar acquaintances. We were received in a remarkably
hilarious manner, and some of the most
jovial of our friends pressed their regards rather
closely, by playing off two or three practical jokes
upon Mr. Sooterkins. The application of a quart
pot to the head of the most forward of these wits
sent him howling into a corner, and, to my unspeakable
satisfaction, put a very sudden conclusion to the
incipient merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take that,” growled Sooterkins, “and now, as
you gen’l’mn seems to be so ’ighly delighted at
this here cheerful occasion, you’ll just ’ave the
goodness to leave me and my pal to our own
cards for a brace of minnits. You see, Bill, ve
must speak to Sal, and git posted up on this last
score. Hollo! Sal! you old limb of Satan, move
yer shanks this way, I tell ye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A withered crone, who seemed to be the mistress
of the cellar, came hobbling forward, being thus politely
conjured to appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wot!” said she, extending her wrinkled hand to
me. “Gentleman Bill here! Here’s a sight for
sore eyes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dight your gab,” interrupted Sooterkins. “Bill’s
here, but he’ll be obliged to cut and run this darkey,
for the beaks are a’ter him ’bout that job of Ikey’s.
Now <span class='it'>he’s</span> got no stump, and the devil a mag have I,
so you must fork over, for the purchase wot come
in vos fairly vorth double as much nor you paid for
it. Bill, and Ikey, and I, are all in fur the business,
but the blackguard daren’t peach on me, ’cause if
he gits off from this scrape, I knows enough of other
matters about him to bring him to a hemp crawat
wery speedily. You’ve got the plunder, you old
hag, and it’s only fair as you should come down
with the tin for the tramp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Gabe,” said the old woman, “you will drive
hard bargains with me. But I can’t well refuse for
the pretty face of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Singular as it may appear. I felt gratified by the
compliment of the hag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mother,” said I, “change of air is good for
the constitution, and I’ll cheat Jack Ketch of his
fees in spite of fate for this bout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much can you do vith?” queried Mr.
Sooterkins, who had lighted a fragment of a clay
pipe, and commenced to smoke most industriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten pounds will carry me on to Portsmouth,”
said I, for the localities and resources of roguery
were fast becoming familiar to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much,” grumbled the crone. Gabe was
about to make a savage reply, when two females descended
the ladder, and entered the cellar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my forks!” whistled Gabe. “This ’ere is
just wot I hoped vouldn’t ’appen; but these cussed
gals is everlastin’ly a riggin a man, till he trots over
the Old Bailey valls on a vooden oss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill!” cried one of the females, recognizing and
running to me. “Is it you, Bill? I’ve been over
the whole of this blessed town after you, for I heard
that Ikey Solomon had let all out, and I feared that
you were caught. But, thank Heaven, you’re safe—you’re
safe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an hysterical burst of laughter, the girl threw
her arms around me and embraced me tightly. Her
laughter gradually ceased, and gave way to a violent
fit of weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amazed at first, and not knowing what she could
mean, the truth began to break upon me. Poor girl!
The burglar’s mistress! What a world of guilt and
wo are in those words! Her face was handsome,
but oh! how deadly pale, save on the summit of the
cheek-bones, where the fire of the hectic blazed.
Her large, dark orbs were sunken, and gleamed like
the reflected glow of a furnace from their deep cavities.
Her apparel, which was a shade or two better
than that of her companion, and her language, which
showed her to be superior to the wretched assemblage
around us, told a tale of sorrow—which, although
a common tale, struck deeply on my heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it, Bess,” said Sooterkins, endeavoring to
push the girl away, “vot dost mean, crying
and sniveling about a chap ven his wery life hangs
on his speed in gettin’ out o’Lunnun? Stand aside,
thou foolish jade, and let me have my say out vith
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand by, Bess dear,” said I, “and I will speak
with you directly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then,” said Sooterkins, “As I’ve vormed
the ten pounds out o’ Sal, all you’ve got to do is this.
Be off now, d’rectly, and take all the by cuts till
you’re out o’ town, snug in the fields. I’ve a friend
as goes down on the mail in the morning, and mind,
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
give him this jark. He’ll be down on the sly with
you, for my sake. Then pull for Common Hard, and
off over the Channel, till this ’ere job blows by. Lose
no time, the night’s dark, and make forward like the
wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Bess?” said I, for the girl’s affection had interested
me, and the emotions of my burglar friend
began to quicken in my breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said Sooterkins, “why canst not mind
thine own affairs, and let the girl alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must speak to her before I go, Gabe,” I replied.
“What she is, I have made her, and it would break
my heart to leave her thus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak, then, fool, and be spry about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bess,” said I, stealing my arm around the waist of
the unfortunate girl, “I must be off for Portsmouth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going, Bill?” she said, in a low and
tremulous voice, as she lifted her eyes anxiously
to mine; and that expression cut me to the soul, keen
as a knife, “I never shall see you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, dearest, you must not speak so. We shall
see each other soon, and live as happy days as ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the young girl became suffused with
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy! No, Bill, I never shall know happiness
again. I have been weak and ill of late. I’m dying,
Bill, and I know it. Before you will dare to return
here, I shall be laid, in the parish shell, cold enough
in the grave of a pauper. Do you remember the
little cottage near the Downs? Ah! those were my
happy days. Then I was innocent, but you—but I
wont speak of that, dearest, for I would not distress
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Bess, compose yourself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the sleep of death? There is no other composure
for me. You are going, and the strings of my
heart snap as I look upon you for the last time. Oh!
through misery and crime, Bill—and we have been
miserable and criminal—I have loved you, dearer
than the light of heaven! But, dearest, if you do
escape and return, quit this awful life, for the sake
of her whom you once vowed never to abandon—quit
this den of villainy, and for God’s sake, oh,
never enter it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears gushed from my eyes at this appeal, and
my whole frame was shaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise—I swear it,” whispered I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dearest. Take this little ring. You
know its history. And now, for the last time, this
kiss. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her head sunk upon her breast. Bestowing an
embrace upon her, I darted from her side, and sprang
up the steps of the cellar. At the foot I paused for a
moment. Bess had hidden her face in her lap, and
the heaving of her breast, plainly perceptible through
its thin covering, testified the agony of her spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The labyrinths of the dark and dingy by-streets
seemed familiar to me as the interior of my own
house. In fact, I was becoming rapidly identified
with the character, as well as with the person of the
burglar. But as I sped on, the recollection of my
former condition was forcibly recalled, as I came
upon a tailor’s shop, ostentatiously placed at the
corner of a well lighted street. The view of that shop
acted as a talisman. It recalled me to a due sense,
and to a most painful recollection of the transactions
of the preceding night, and of my rencontre in Hyde
Park with the usurper of my rights. I recollected
perfectly well that I had received an invitation to a
grand gala at Lord Flannery’s for this evening, of
which I doubted not for an instant that my representative
would avail himself. Julia, I also knew, had
promised to be there. Curiosity, no less than jealousy,
spurred me on. I felt a strong desire to see
in what manner and to what advantage I should appear.
I determined to make my way to his lordship’s,
forgetting that if the police laid eyes upon me,
I should dangle most loftily from the front of Newgate
or the Old Bailey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onward I strode until I reached Grosvenor Square,
from near which point I had started on my morning
peregrinations. It was past eleven o’clock. I stationed
myself in front of Lord Flannery’s mansion,
where the glow of lights, crowds of liveried menials,
and the sound of music indicated the commencement
of the rout. Equipage after equipage rolled up, and
depositing their inmates at the door, drove off in rapid
succession. Crowds of fashionables swarmed the
apartments. I waited for Julia’s arrival until my
patience was nearly exhausted, and I was upon the
point of giving the matter up in despair, when a magnificent
turn-out drove up to the door, and Flashington
<a id='Highflyer'></a>Highflyer, Esquire, descended from the vehicle, attired
in a most <span class='it'>recherché</span> evening dress, and handed
out—<span class='it'>proh pudor!</span>—the Honorable Miss Julia Adeliza
Dashleigh!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was petrified with astonishment. There was the
figure which had excited her laughter but the previous
night, and which was evidently the present object
of her favorable regard. As the pair passed me,
the light from the hall shone strongly upon my features.
My representative gave me, <span class='it'>en passant</span>, a
most facetious dig in the small ribs with his elbow,
and suddenly clapping his hands upon his pockets,
exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are thieves here! I have lost my snuff-box
and my handkerchief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mr. Highflyer!” said Julia, with a winning
glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Secure this fellow,” said the hateful scoundrel,
for whose crimes I was penitently atoning, pointing
to me. “He has a suspicious look. Bring him into
the hall. Come, <span class='it'>dearest</span> Julia, I will attend you to
the dressing-room, and will then return to examine
this man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly I was pounced upon by a police officer,
assisted by a dozen servants, and in spite of my cries
and protestations of innocence, was dragged into the
hall. Mr. Highflyer was not long in making his appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Search him, officer,” said he, as he drew out his
tooth-pick, and planted himself in a very Lara-like
style, with his back to the banisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You infernal, thieving, rope-cracking black-guard!”
I roared, goaded to the very verge of insanity
by these accumulated misadventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
“Gag him,” said my tormentor. “Have you found
any thing, officer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, sir,” replied that functionary, “Is this
here vipe yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shocking to relate, the missing articles were found
upon me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That handkerchief is mine, as well as the snuff-box.
I shall appear to prosecute. Off with him to
Bow Street. A p-r-e-e-tt-y good-looking chap for a
pickpocket,” continued he, as he turned his head
with a supercilious smile, and examined me through
his eye-glass. The smile gave way to a sneer of the
most diabolical description as he ascended the staircase.
I had never thought myself so confoundedly
ugly as I did at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course I was dragged off to the police-office,
upon the charge of robbing myself. All that I could
say would be of no avail, therefore I kept a most
stoical silence. Having arrived at our destination, I
was walked in before the head of the police, who,
after a long and scrutinizing survey of my person,
whispered an officer, who went out. I was then desired,
or rather commanded, to extend my wrists to
another officer, who placed upon them a very ornamental,
but not very agreeable appendage, in the
shape of a pair of manacles. I had subsided into a
dogged, sullen, almost unconscious state of mind,
and was becoming, in fact, very careless as regarded
consequences. Half an hour had elapsed, when the
officer who had spoken with the chief of police, returned.
He whispered the presiding functionary,
who grinned approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my kiddy,” said he, “the Saffron-Hill job
warn’t enough for you, eh? But I’ve caged you
now, bird, and you’ll be made to sing plenty loud
for that matter, outcepting this altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heerd the like of this lark,” said the under-strapper.
“It’s a rigler demeanin’ of the trade. Here’s
one of your Jimmy burglary swells come down to
a-sneak of a pickpocket!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be a work of supererogation to detail
the variety of insults and the tortures of mind that
I was forced to undergo from my appearance before
the magistrate the next morning, until my final trial
at the Old Bailey upon the charge of burglary. I had
heard nothing of my ingenious tyrant, who was evidently,
at the time I saw him last, in a very fair way
to lead my lady-love to the altar. Nor, indeed, had
I any opportunity of hearing from him. I saw no
persons save my keeper, and a little, seedy, Jew
attorney, whom I discovered to be in pay of the gang
of which I was a worthy member. After various
consultations with this gentleman, who informed
me that he would be able, in spite of the veracious
testimony of the respectable Mr. Ikey Solomons, to
produce a satisfactory alibi, it was decided that I was
to put in the plea of Not Guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day of trial arrived, after a weary and solitary
residence within the walls of my prison of a month.
None of the gang came near me, and I could never
learn any tidings of Bess. At the appointed time, I
was escorted into the court, and being duly arraigned,
the charge was read to me, in that agreeable nasality
of tone peculiar to the clerks of all legal tribunals.
During this process, to which I paid not the least attention,
I espied a newspaper lying by the side of
the dock. I picked it up, and was vacantly pouring
over the columns, unseen by my jailers, when my
attention was riveted by the following paragraph,
which filled my breast with horror and despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married, by the Right Rev. Doctor Dumfungle,
at St. Martin’s in the Fields, Flashington Highflyer,
Esq., to the Hon. Julia Adeliza, daughter of Sir
Poins Dashleigh, Bart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The climax to my sorrows had then arrived. The
whole man was quelled within me. Spectators,
judge and jury were all forgotten, and the tide of
my woes rushed irresistibly onward, overwhelming
me in the vortex. The question was put in the usual
form, “guilty or not guilty?” Life had cloyed with
me. I longed to occupy a resting place where I
should be secure from the scorn and the persecutions
of the world. The grave offered this refuge, and I
gladly embraced it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I therefore rose from my seat, and replied to the
query of the clerk, “guilty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My attorney fairly fell under the table with <a id='aston'></a>astonishment.
The whole assemblage seemed utterly confounded
at my audacity, and a voice was heard
above the general buz of tongues, which I recognized
as appertaining to my acquaintance, Mr.
Sooterkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vell, by blazes, h’aint you gone and done it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course I was sentenced to be hanged. Day
after day dragged on its weary course, and as I
gazed at the gray walls of my dungeon, my heart
seemed to harden like the stone itself. In vain did
the ministers of the gospel strive to arouse me from
my apathy. All was cold and dead within me. The
day before that which was fixed for my execution,
to my extreme surprise, Mr. Flashington Highflyer
entered my cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time indignation chained up my tongue.
I experienced a choking sensation as I stared furiously
upon my visiter, whose countenance was
drawn out into the most hypocritical length. This
did not very long continue, for the solemn visage
which he had chosen to exhibit at his entrance soon
gave place to a most malicious and devilish sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he, with an odious chuckle, “my
fine fellow, how d’ye like your bargain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Avaunt, fiend!” I exclaimed. He certainly
manifested no symptoms of departure, but lolling
upon my bunk, produced a Havana from his mother-of-pearl
cigar-case, and igniting it by means of
a Lucifer, commenced to smoke with great <span class='it'>sang
froid</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty pleasant lodgings, those of yours, my old
chap, but your wardrobe was horridly low and vulgar.
In fact, I was compelled to make a bonfire of all your
old clothes, before I could manage to put it into
tolerable order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You infernal scoundrel!” I roared, goaded to
madness by this last insult. “I told you that you
should pay for your rascality, and, by heaven, you
shall pay for it now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
As I spoke, I rushed upon him and grappled tightly
with him. He resisted strenuously, but rage had
nerved me with the strength of a dozen men, and
seizing him by the throat, we rolled upon the ground
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ya—ya—yough! Gollamity, massa, what you
do? Want fur choke Sip?—oh, murder! murder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked with bewildered eyes around me. I had
upset the table, tumbled from my chair upon the
floor, and had grappled poor Scipio by the throat,
until his eye-balls protruded an inch from his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollo!” I cried, “where the devil am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you home, be sure, massa,” replied
Scipio, whimpering from the effects of the rough
salutation I had bestowed upon him, “and be broad
daylight, and you no bin to bed yit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at the decanter. It was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” ejaculated I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The odious apparel of the preceding night still
decked my person and strewed the room. There
was a sickening odor of stale tobacco-smoke hovering
through the chamber, and, with a very clear
perception that I should require a tumbler of Hock
and soda to reinvigorate the inner man, I arrived at
the comfortable conclusion that I was still in <span class='it'>propria
persona</span>, the “man who could never dress well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>P. S. I’m off to Paris. Fitzcrocky has Julia’s
promise. A pea-green coat with gilt buttons, and
a scarlet satin lining has done my business.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>[SEE ENGRAVING.]</p>

<p class='pindent'>We present our readers this month with the first
of a series of views which, by permission, we have
caused to be engraved expressly for this Magazine,
from Mr. John R. Smith’s celebrated Panorama of
the Mississippi River. It represents the cotton plantation
belonging to the recently elected President of
the U. S., General Zachary Taylor. It is situated
on the eastern branch of the Mississippi River, in
Jefferson county, Mississippi, seven miles below the
town of Rodney, between the estates of James Suggett,
on the north, and Colonel Barker, on the south.
The view embraces the overseer’s house, the
cottages of the laborers, with a small portion of the
broad acres which are comprised in the plantation.
The spot is interesting, not only as being the property
and the occasional residence of a distinguished
public man, but as affording a specimen of those
cotton estates, the culture of which exerts so important
an influence on the commercial and financial
destinies of the republic.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>THE WHIP-POOR-WILL.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This singular bird is found throughout the greater
portion of the United States, and by the notes from
which it derives its name is known to almost every
farmer. The species was long considered identical
with the Night Hawk; but this fallacy was fully exposed
by Wilson. The Whip-poor-will appears in
the Middle States toward the end of April, when its
low, sad wail, may be heard at evening along the
creeks and by the woods of the country. So peculiarly
mournful is this sound that the ignorant almost
invariably consider it an omen of approaching evil.
By the Indians it is regarded as a spirit-voice, boding
death or perhaps national calamity. The bird articulates
pretty distinctly the syllables <span class='it'>whip-poor-will</span>,
the first and last being uttered with great emphasis.
A kind of chuckling sound sometimes precedes the
principal tone. At these times the bird is generally
on the wing, flying close to the ground in the manner
of swallows, and sometimes skimming around houses.
The notes of the Whip-poor-will are continued until
about midnight, and on fine moonlight nights until
morning. The shady banks of creeks and rivulets
are favorite haunts. During the day they remain in
the darkest parts of the forest, hushed to silence like
owls, and apparently annoyed at the presence of sunlight.
The cry of the Whip-poor-will is not heard
after the middle of June; and early in September it
departs for the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Whip-poor-will is nine inches and a-half long,
of a beautiful mottled-brown, relieved by other colors.
It is noted for an extravagantly large mouth, beset on
each side with thick bristles, and for a very strong
bill. The female is less in size than the male, and
rather lighter colored. She begins to lay toward the
middle of May, choosing for this purpose a dry situation,
covered with brush, decayed leaves, etc., but
building no nest. The eggs are two in number, dark
and marbled. The young appear early in June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Goatsucker, Night Hawk, and seventeen other
species belong to the same genus as the Whip-poor-will.
Of these fifteen belong to America. Nuttall
has the following remarks on some of these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if superstition takes alarm at our familiar
and simple species, what would be thought by the
ignorant of a South American kind, large as the
Wood Owl, which, in the lonely forests of Demerara,
about midnight, breaks out, lamenting like one in
deep distress, and in a tone more dismal even than
the painful hexachord of the slothful Ai. The sounds
like the expiring sighs of some agonizing victim,
begin with a high, loud note, ‘<span class='it'>ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! ha!
ha!</span>’ each tone falling lower and lower, till the last
syllable is scarcely heard, pausing a moment or two
between this reiterated tale of seeming madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four other species of the Goat-sucker, according
to Waterton, also inhabit the tropical wilderness,
among which is included our present subject. Figure
to yourself the surprise and wonder of the stranger
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
who takes up his solitary abode for the first night
amidst these awful and interminable forests, when,
at twilight, he begins to be assailed familiarly with a
spectral equivocal bird, approaching within a few
yards, and then accosting him with ‘<span class='it'>who-are-you,
who—who—who are you?</span>’ Another approaches,
and bids him, as if a slave under the lash, ‘<span class='it'>work-away,
work—work—work-away!</span>’ A third, mournfully
cries, ‘<span class='it'>willy come go, willy—willy—willy
come go!</span>’ and as you get among the highlands, our
old acquaintance vociferates, ‘<span class='it'>whip-poor-will,
whip—whip—whip-poor-will!</span>’ It is, therefore, not surprising
that such unearthly sounds should be considered
in the light of supernatural forebodings issuing
from spectres in the guise of birds.”</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This lively and beautiful bird is widely diffused
through the United States under the names of Oriole,
Hanging-Bird, Golden Robin, Fire Bird, and Baltimore
Bird. According to Catesby, the latter name
originates from the colors of its plumage being the
same as that of Lord Baltimore’s livery. It is seven
inches in length. The head, throat, and upper part
of the back, are black, and the remaining portions
bright orange, inclining to vermilion on the breast,
with some white among the feathers of the wings.
The colors of the female are less bright than those of
the male, and she is somewhat smaller. The male
does not acquire his full plumage until the third spring,
undergoing in the intermediate time many singular
changes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Oriole family are distinguished for the singular
manner of building. “For this purpose,” says
Wilson, “he generally fixes on the high-bending extremities
of the branches, fastening strong strings of
hemp or flax round two forked twigs, corresponding
to the intended width of the nest. With the same
materials, mixed with quantities of loose tow, he
interweaves or fabricates a strong, firm kind of cloth,
not unlike the substance of a hat in its raw state,
forming it into a pouch of six or seven inches in
depth, lining it substantially with various soft substances
well interwoven with the outward netting,
and lastly, finishes with a layer of horse-hair; the
whole being shaded from the sun and rain by a
natural pent-house or canopy of leaves.” The solicitude
of the Baltimore to obtain proper materials for
his nest, often leads him to commit depredations on
the farmer’s hemp, or the thread and silk of the
housewife. Skeins of these materials have been
found in the nest after its being deserted by the
young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Nuttall, the Oriole possesses a propensity
to imitate other birds. He is particular in
describing their natural notes. “The mellow-whistled
notes which they are heard to trumpet from the
high branches of our tallest trees and gigantic elms,
resemble at times, <span class='it'>tshippe-tshayia too too</span>, and
<span class='it'>’tshippee-’tshippee, too too</span>, (with the two last syllables
loud and full.) These notes are also varied so
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
as to resemble <span class='it'>’tsh, ’tsh ’tsheet shoo tshoo tshoo</span>,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> also
<span class='it'>tsh, ’tsheefa ’tsheefa tshoo</span> and <span class='it'>’k’túfatúf a túf a
téa kerry</span>.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> Another bird I have occasionally heard
to call for hours, with some little variation, <span class='it'>tu teo
teo teo too</span>, in a loud, querulous, and yet almost ridiculously
merry strain. At other intervals, the sensations
of solitude seem to stimulate sometimes a loud
interrogatory note, echoed forth at intervals, as <span class='it'>k’rry
kerry?</span> and terminating plaintively <span class='it'>k’rry k’rry tu</span>,
the voice falling off very slenderly in the last long
syllable, which is apparently an imitation from the
Cardinal Grosbeak, and the rest is derived from the
Crested Titmouse, whom they have heard already in
concert as they passed through the warmer states.
Another interrogatory strain which I heard in the
spring of 1830, was precisely <span class='it'>’yip ’k’rry, ’yip ’yip
k’rry</span>, very loud and oft repeated. Another male
went in his ordinary key, <span class='it'>tsherry tsherry, tshipee</span>
<span class='it'>tsh’rry</span>, notes copied from the exhaustless stock of
the Carolina Wren, (also heard on his passage,) but
modulated to suit the fancy of our vocalist. The female
likewise sings, but less agreeably than the male.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This particularity in describing sounds which
are almost indescribable may seem frivolous to some of
our readers, but those who have ever listened to the
melting notes of the Baltimore Oriole will pardon
this accurate observer of nature the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The common food of the Oriole is insects, especially
a species of small beetle. They are said to
love the honey in the blossoms of trees. If domesticated,
they must still be fed on animal food, principally
minced meat, soaked in milk. When adult,
they will also eat fruit-cakes and meal. They are
not difficult to tame, and form a pleasant pet. Their
eggs are four or five in number, white, with dark
lines and spots. In the Southern States they sometimes
raise two broods; but further northward only
one. The Oriole extends over the continent as far
south as Brazil, where hundreds of nests are found in
every forest.</p>

<p class='line'>A rose-tree lived ’neath this agéd one,</p>
<p class='line'>Concealed from the noontide rays of the sun,</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the shade of the dark pine-tree.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>With most of us it is only when we are nigh unto death
that we learn what it is to live. We talk of acquainting
ourselves with the lives of eminent persons, when we
read a record of the events through which they have passed;
we call our own lives desolate, because events of a painful
nature have befallen us; but these are not our life. Life—the
principle which makes us sentient, intelligent, active
beings; the principle by which we hold converse with
the living spirit of beauty and goodness, by which—if we
pervert not its heavenly aims—assimilating with that
spirit incarnated in the adorable Saviour, we rise from the
finite to the infinite, and, resting on the bosom of love,
find blessedness when that which made our happiness has
vanished from our grasp; this life no events can make
desolate. Sorrow may darken our sky, but the loving,
trusting child of God rises above its gloomy cloud, and
there shines his life supremely bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
Who shall penetrate into the spirit’s mysterious intercourse
with Him, who inhabiting eternity, yet dwelleth
with the humble and contrite heart? Reverently and humbly
to illustrate this precious truth, to show that in His presence
earth’s discords are harmonized, and peace and
strength arise where all was disorder and weakness may
be permitted—but there let us pause, lest we be as the
fools who “rush in where angels dare not tread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long experience of any thing existing, has shown mankind
all its benefits and all its evils; but beside this, there
is an indirect advantage in retaining that which is, namely,
that it has adjusted itself to the things by which it is surrounded;
and there is an indirect disadvantage in change,
namely, that one can never calculate what derangements of
all relations may take place, by any great alteration of
even one small part in the complicated machine of any
state or society.</p>

<hr class='tbk137'/>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to find words to express the infinite; and
although it may seem a pleonasmatic expression, I must
say that all the varieties of human character have infinite
varieties within themselves. However, the easily impressible
character, that which suffers opinions, feelings,
thoughts, purposes, actions to be continually altered by
the changing circumstances around—the chameleon character,
if I may so call it—is, perhaps, the most dangerous
to itself, and to those it affects, of any that I know. It
goes beyond the chameleon, indeed. The reptile only reflects
the colors of objects near, retaining its own form
and nature. The impressible character, on the contrary,
is changed in every line, as well as in every hue, by that
with which it comes in contact. Certain attributes it
certainly does retain. The substance is the same, but the
color and the form are always varying. In the substance
lies the permanence and the identity. All else is moulded
and painted by circumstance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pure, ingenuous, open-hearted candor of early years,
would be a better friend to man, if he did but cling to it

prudence, selfishness, wit, or even wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This novel is the production of a New England writer
of fine talents and large acquirements, but of talents and
acquirements which have not been as bountifully expressed
in literature as the Public, that exacting leech of intellects
raised above the mass, had a right to demand. The work,
with some obvious defects, evinces a range of characterization,
and a general opulence of mind, which place it
above many novels which can claim more felicity in the
evolution of a story and more variety of incident. The
scene is laid in the early history of Massachusetts, commencing
about eight years after the landing of the Pilgrims
at Plymouth, and its peculiarity consists in vividly
reproducing to the imagination a period which even the
driest annalists have hardly touched. The novel might
with propriety be called, “The Cavaliers in Massachusetts,”
for its originality, as an American story, consists
in bringing together Cavalier and Roundhead on New
England ground. The hero, Morton, is a loose, licentious,
scheming, good-natured, and good-for-nothing English
“gentleman,” engaged in a project to outwit the Puritans,
and to obtain the ascendancy in Massachusetts of a different
code of principles and a different kind of government
from those which the Puritans aimed to establish.
Connected with this reckless Cavalier is a deeper plotter,
Sir Christopher Gardiner, a villain half after James’s and
half after Bulwer’s heart, pursuing schemes of empire and
schemes of seduction with equal ingenuity and equal ill-success.
These two, with the followers and liege men of
Morton—a gang of ferocities, rascalities and un-moralities
from the lowest London taverns—constitute the chief
carnal ingredients of the novel. Opposed to these we
have grand and life-like portraits of Miles Standish, Endicott,
Winthrop, and other Puritan celebrities, with only
an occasional view of the Indians. The business of the
affections is principally transacted by two persons—a pure,
elevated, large-hearted and high-spirited woman, and a
noble-minded but somewhat irascible man; and this
portion of the novel has the ecstasies and agonies which
are appropriate to the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We think the novel a real addition to American literature,
whether considered in respect to the amount of new
information it conveys, or the splendor, vivacity and distinctness
of its representations both of character and
scenery. A dozen passages might be extracted, which,
viewed simply as descriptions, are grand enough to establish
a reputation. But the author’s great merit consists
in having as clear and distinct a notion of the Cavalier, in
his daily life and conversation, as of the Puritan, and this
merit, rare in an American, he could only have obtained from
a profound study of the elder dramatists of England, and a
vivid insight into the very heart of their characters. Out of
Scott, we do not know where to look for finer representations
of these two great classes of English society, as they
must have appeared when brought into opposition to each
other. No one familiar with Marston, Deckar, Beaumont
and Fletcher, or any other dramatist in whose plays the
bullies and minor reprobates of the Elizabethan age appear,
will call even Bootefish, Cakebread and Company, improbable
or unnatural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leading defect of the novel is the lack of a steady,
orderly and artistical development of the plot. The narrative
wants rapidity of movement; the rich materials of
the work are imperfectly fused together; and occasionally
things good in themselves seem to be in each other’s way.
All those faults which beset the creations of the most fertile
intellects, when they aim to give great variety of incident
and character without having a grand, leading, ever-present
conception of their work as a whole, are visible in this
novel, and mar its harmony as a work of art. But these
defects inhere in many romances which are read with delight
by thousands, and though the splendid talents of the
author of Merry-Mount may not always hide the heterogeneousness
of his plan, they are amply sufficient to prevent
it from interfering seriously with the interest of his novel,
and sufficient also to delineate persons and scenes which
leave on the reader’s mind a strong impression of power and
beauty.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Female Poets of America. By Rufus W. Griswold.
Philadelphia: Carey &amp; Hart. 1 vol. 8mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the space of four hundred closely printed pages, Mr.
Griswold has here brought together some ninety of our
female poets, and introduced them with critical and biographical
notices. Of all Mr. Griswold’s various works,
the present evinces the greatest triumph over difficulties,
and best demonstrates the minuteness and the extent of
his knowledge of American literature. Very few of the
women included in this collection have ever published editions
of their writings, and a considerable portion of the
verse was published anonymously. The labor, therefore,
of collecting the materials both of the biographies and the
illustrative extracts, must have been of that arduous and
vexatious kind which only enthusiasm for the subject
could have sustained. The volume is an important original
contribution to the literary history of the country, and
nobody, whose mind is not incurably vitiated by prejudice,
can make dissimilarity of opinion with regard to some of
the judgments expressed in the book, a ground for denying
its general ability, honesty and value. Most of the materials
are strictly new, and this fact of itself is sufficient
to stamp the work with that character which distinguishes
books of original research from mere compilations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Griswold has given us a fine preface, in which he
ably vindicates and acutely limits the genius of women.
The biographies and extracts which follow, commence
with Mrs. Anne Bradstreet and close with Miss Phillips.
Between these two he has included an amount of beautiful
and touching poetry which will surprise even those who
are inclined to take the most elevated view of the intellectual
excellence of their countrywomen. We have here
the lofty and energetic thought of Miss Townsend, the
bright fancy and primitive feeling of Miss Gould, the impassioned
imagination and deep discernment of Maria
Brooks, the holy and meditative spirit of Mrs. Sigourney,
the tender and graceful sentiment of Mrs. Embury; Mrs.
Whitman, with her grasp of all literatures, her keen
thought which pierces through nature’s most mystical
symbols, and her ethereal spirit casting on every object
that light “which never was on sea or land;” Mrs. Oakes
Smith, with her constant sense of the pure and the good,
her daring and shaping imagination, before whose creations
and revelations her soul shrinks awed and subdued,
and her deep feeling of the spiritual significance of things—a
woman worthy to be the companion of Plato; Fanny
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
Osgood, the most brilliant and graceful of poetesses, with
her quick decisive sensibility, and her teeming and exhaustless
fancy, eloquent of love and romance, and high-heartedness
in every relation of life; Miss Lynch, simple,
austere, bold, despising ornament as ornament, and keeping
her raised eye fixed on the vanishing features of the elusive
thought she aims to shape into almost sculptural form;
Grace Greenwood, with her fine combination of the tender
and the impassioned in feeling, and the subtile and grand
in thought, “with a heart in her brain and a brain in her
heart;”—all these, and many more whom we lack epithets
to characterize rather than desire to celebrate, appear in
Mr. Griswold’s volume in all the royalty of womanhood.
To proceed further in description would be merely to enumerate
names, without being able to suggest things. In
addition to the notables, whose names are known to all
readers of the magazines, Mr. Griswold has included in
his collection, many a timid violet and daisy of womanhood,
too modest and sensitive not to feel the fear of notoriety,
and has transplanted it to his book with a delicacy
as commendable as the taste which dictated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, we have only to observe that a volume, so
complimentary to the genius of our countrywomen, can
hardly be read without a feeling of exultation and pride.
We trust it will meet that wide circulation it so richly
deserves.</p>

Observations, designed to delineate Life, Man, and the
World. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This beautiful volume is the result of a life of observation
and thought. The author has traveled in every part
of the globe, and viewed mankind in a greater variety of
aspects than most of those who meditate as well as observe.
He has thrown his reflections into a somewhat
quaint form, and has but a few words for even the greatest
topics, but whatever he touches he either adorns or illuminates,
and his book furnishes numberless texts for
essays. Like most writers of maxims, he has a sardonic
element in his mind, and occasionally disposes of an important
matter, deserving serious discussion, with a gibe
or a fleer, and sometimes descends even to flippancy and
impertinence; but these are the almost inevitable vices of
the form of composition he has chosen, and he has fewer
of them than might be expected. A good part of the raciness
of such books as Acton comes from the occasional
substitution of the writer’s impressions or prejudices for
general truths. The didactic tone of such compositions
is in this way relieved, and a paradox or a piece of acute
nonsense thrown in, here and there, reminds us that it is
a person who is thinking, not a moral and reasoning machine.
The author of the present work has been especially
successful in giving an individuality to his general remarks,
and preserving them from the abstract and “do-me-good”
character of impersonal morality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume is so laden with striking thoughts and observations,
that it is difficult to fix upon any deserving
especial quotation. As a specimen of the writer’s manner,
the following on Genius and Talent may serve:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talent is strength and subtlety of mind, genius is
mental inspiration and delicacy of feeling. Talent possesses
vigor and acuteness of penetration, but is surpassed
by the vivid intellectual conceptions of genius. The
former is skillful and bold, the latter aspiring and gentle;
but talent excels in practical sagacity, and hence those
striking contrasts so often witnessed in the world, the
triumph of talent through its adroit and active energies,
and the adversities of genius in the midst of its boundless
but unattainable aspirations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talent is the Lion and the Serpent; Genius is the
Eagle and the Dove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or the first is like some conspicuous flower which
flaunts its glory in the sunshine, while the last resembles
the odoriferous spikenard’s root, whose sweetness is concealed
in the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The flower displays itself openly, the root must be
extracted from the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a piece of verse, in a different vein, on a very
common dispensation of Providence, the Mean Fellow.
We fear that few are so fortunate as not to be able to apply
it to some acquaintance or enemy:</p>

<p class='line0'>By every honest man contemn’d,</p>

Centuries. Edited by Rufus W. Griswold. Illustrated

1 vol. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is a strange impression current even among people
who ought to know better, that religious poetry is a form
of composition confined to poets of the third or fourth
class, and chiefly valuable for Hymn Books. The existence
of any verse, instinct with the finest essence of
poetry, and glowing with the rapt and holy passions of the
religious bard, is practically denied. Now nothing is more
certain than that poetry, impassioned imagination, is essentially
religious both in its nature and its expression. It
springs from that raised mood of mind in which the object
present to thought is worshiped. This is true even in poetry
relating to the senses and to human passion, for if we scrutinize
it sharply, we shall find that the object which fills the
poet’s mind, however low in itself, is still deified for the
moment, and made the exclusive object of his adoration.
In this way bards often make gods of persons and things
very questionable in themselves, but this is owing rather
to the direction than the nature of the poet’s powers. If
these powers instead of being devoted to the idealization
of appetite or destructive passions, be directed upward to
the true object of worship, the poetry will be really more
beautiful and sublime than if it were merely confined to
spiritualized sensations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one can glance over Mr. Griswold’s beautiful book
without feeling how rich is English literature in song,
celebrating the beauty of holiness and the infinite perfections
of God. The compilation comprehends the early as
well as the later English poets, and contains some exquisite
but not generally known extracts from Spenser,
Gascoigne, Drayton, Sir Henry Wottan, Davies, Carew,
Ben Jonson, Drummond, Fletcher, Donne, Sir John Beaumont,
Wither, Herrick, Quarles, Vaughan and Herbert.
The holy poets of a later date, both of England and America,
are likewise profusely quoted, and the whole collection
is well deserving a place in every family library in
the country.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_28'><span class='bold'>“GRAHAM” TO “JEREMY SHORT.”</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Jeremy</span>,—Your name would be euphonious
in the stock-market, at times; but I believe stocks are
muddied waters in which you seldom dabble. You are
wise. But do you find yourself at all in the <span class='it'>vein</span> speculative,
particularly now, when the streams of that new
El Dorado, California, sparkle invitingly with yellow
pebbles? and its many broad acres spread themselves out
temptingly, with their bowels of undug gold, begging for
pickaxe, shovel and basin? How many ears heretofore
closed to the artifices of the speculator, are pricked up, or
belie their masters, at the all-enchanting sound of the
word <span class='sc'>Gold</span>!! With all the close calculation and keen
spirit of inquiry which mark us as a nation, I fear me that
Jonathan has his weakness, and that his soft side is metallic.
There is something in the clinking of gold and
silver that sets aside his ordinary caution and shrewdness,
and leads him to do very silly things to get at it. It belongs
to his nature to be impetuous, and continued success
leads him into very rash ventures. A more interrupted
fortune would, in this case, have allowed him
breathing time to make a “calculation;” and when Jonathan
does that coolly, he is seldom overreached. But he
has flogged the Mexicans, taken the territory that he
wanted—as he knew he would—and he is ready now to
believe that the golden pavements of the <a id='incas'></a>Incas were no
fable, and that the streams in California are walled in
with gold, if you will. At least he will believe it until he
sees for himself. He is a little taken by surprise with this
glittering bait, and no trout dashes at a tempting fly with
a more ravenous bite than he does at these shining
“placers.” What cares he for the thousands of miles
that intervene; for the storms of winter that howl around
the Horn, and threaten danger and death! At the first
glimpse of the prospect, a thousand sails are set, and
whitening the ocean, bear him to fortune. No ordinary
comforts, no moderate success here, restrains his keen
thirst of adventure. Were home a paradise, and California
a desert, with its shores bristling with opposing
bayonets, and parked with roaring artillery, he would go.
Yes! he would, perhaps, rather go then than now. The
glory of the achievement would enhance the value of the
wealth. The founder of Nations—he must work out a
prophecy. Already the cry of a great people goes up with
a shout from the once desolate hills, and ardent, panting
thousands, answer the cry with, “<span style='font-size:smaller'>WE COME!</span>” and the
shout swells with a louder triumph, a more emphatic joy,
for “<span class='it'>a nation is born in a day!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impetuous rush to that far-off land is not in itself
striking or marvelous. Other and feebler nations have
shown the same avidity for gold. The Spaniards have
dared more, to quench the same insatiate thirst. But the
Anglo-Saxon heel, upon that soil, seals its greatness and
proclaims its destiny. From every wooded hill-side and
babbling stream—from the snow-capped mountain to the
fertile valley—yes! even over the great desert plains,
where the footstep cracks the crisp soil, a voice has gone
forth, which the Nations hear and obey, proclaiming—<span class='sc'>Be
ye Free!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you not think that the abandoning of all domestic
and personal comfort, sundering of all social and friendly
ties, and rushing into the doubtful companionship of California,
for the mere sake of gold, is a pretty accurate data
from which to estimate a man’s heart, or brain, or both?
Is it not something so absolutely sordid, that one cannot
help losing a little of the respect heretofore entertained
for a friend who is seized with this yellow fever? As if
life had nothing to mitigate the evils of existence but
wealth—indeed, as if we were born only to worship that
as a god—upon whose shrine we are to sacrifice time,
friends, health, and even life itself, to be the masters of so
much tinsel as you can clutch at the altar. Bah! Is there
not in home enjoyments and the society and friendship of
men who know us well, and love us truly, more <span class='it'>real</span>
wealth than all that will ever be attained by the slaves
who sweep the dirt from the streams in California—live
upon frogs and beetles, and fill the air with curses. Think
of men, of even the most ordinary sense of decency, herding—<span class='it'>for
any sum</span>—for months and years with the scum of
every clime; with souls sickened and minds defiled with
their abominations; to be of them, “or not to <span class='it'>be</span>” at all—is
there any consideration that could tempt your avarice
or mine? None that I can think of, unless to gratify
some darling revenge, vigilant and sleepless for years,
which men sometimes cherish for wrongs, and which nothing
but gold could furnish the means of satisfying—even
in that case it would be the <span class='it'>last</span> resort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any friend of yours is solicitous to enrich a patch of
soil, two feet by six, I think I can recommend an Undertaker
who will arrange the thing nicely for him here; it
is not worth while for him to go to California with his
benevolence. For <span class='it'>you</span>, he would be reasonable, as you
are <span class='it'>Short</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, my dear Jeremy, I had no intention of wandering
from my purpose, of giving you a reminding hint of
“Copper Mining.” as a sort of sedative to the gold
“placers.” Some of Jonathan’s younger sons were then
severely bitten, and were so thoroughly <a id='inoculate'></a>inoculated with
the virus, as to have rather a sharpened recollection of
metals. The most of <span class='it'>them</span>, I should think, would be safe
from this <span class='it'>later</span> disease, even in its most violent and contagious
forms. Yet there is something very attractive,
and most dangerously seductive, in delving for minerals,
counting each shovelfull as so many guineas coined, and
already in your pocket. There is no enthusiast more dangerous
than your professional miner. The gentle madness
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
is so infectious that his example may turn the heads
of a whole district. Yet <span class='it'>his</span> bite is not half so venomous
as that of another species—a kind of ground-shark—who
affects the same sort of insanity, and while digging below
ground, puts his “placer” on the “Stock List.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is astonishing, too, that we will be caught once in a
while in this way, while there are people all around us,
<span class='it'>anxious friends</span>, who exclaim, “I knew it!” but who
never hinted a word about the matter. Did it ever strike
you that we live in a very sagacious and knowing world—the
mind of each man being simply the reflection of that
of another? Our brightest fancies are but the suggestions
of other people’s brains—our good fortune in life is
always known beforehand—our reverses have always
been most indubitably predicted by parties, who confirm
their sagacity with a consolatory—“I told you so.” We
are, after all, then, but the mere creatures of the impulses
of other people—our destiny it is to work out their predictions.
The iron energy, the indomitable perseverance,
sleepless vigilance, untiring industry—have all been
weighed beforehand—duly appreciated and predicted.
There is no such thing as surprising any body. It is all
perfectly understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>W—, by a keen sagacity in detecting, and ready tact in
managing a new business, has struck the tide that bears
to fortune. But <span class='it'>he</span> has made no discovery. Forty other
men, with scarcely brains to comprehend, much less originate
an idea, knew all about it. <span class='it'>They told you so!</span>
W— goes on, originates new combinations of trade,
enlarges business ideas, and still succeeds. But <span class='it'>Toldyeso</span>
knew it, and was indifferent.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Sharp</span> has his eye upon W—. “<span class='sc'>Ah!</span>” says he “there
is a man who has a soul above buttons—a <span class='it'>genius</span> for business.
Every thing <span class='it'>he</span> touches turns to gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But W—, with his multitude of irons in the fire, incautiously
takes hold of the hot end of one of them, and is
maimed. “<span class='sc'>Bah!</span>” says Sharp, “I knew how it would
be! He was always <span class='it'>rushing</span> business up against the
stream. Bound to fail—<span class='it'>I told you so</span>!” And yet nobody
ever knew Sharp to originate, or succeed in, any thing—but
<span class='it'>he knows</span>—and that must be some consolation to a
ninny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, Jeremy, not to imitate the folly of this world in
regard to the past, nor to affect the wisdom of the next, to
tell of the future, I have a story about mining to give you
in my next, in which you will find both Sharps and Flats,
which I think will induce you to believe with me—that
people who have cultivated a dangerous intimacy with
Copper-Heads ought to be cautious, and particularly shy
how they <span class='it'>now</span> run after Gold-Bugs with a <span class='it'>hum</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. has been in town, and I passed an evening with him
since last I wrote you. He has still the same joyous
laugh, that used to set the table in a roar, and it is quite
as contagious. At every jest he would burst out with a
sort of a shout in his hearty guffaw, which, if practiced at
home, must wake the echoes of his native mountain. I
was thoughtful over the past, and became partially a convert
to your theory, in regard to the chilling effects of
extra city refinement; and your beautiful picture of country
life, with its honest, hearty friendships, came to my
mind forcibly. It must be true, for I confess I <span class='it'>felt</span> that I
had grown older, and colder, too. Can you, Jeremy,
laugh as of yore—as loud and as long?—with the same
hearty good will and utter <span class='it'>abandon</span>. Or is your mirth
choked and clogged with bitter remembrances, which will
steal upon the heart even in its gayest moments? Thought!
is <span class='it'>it</span> a companion with which you can entertain hilarity?
Or is your joy overshadowed with the darkness of evil
that has been, or that you anticipate, you scarce know
why? I cannot experience the light-heartedness we had
formerly. Perhaps it is that I attempt its cultivation. It
must come of natural buoyancy of spirits, I think, to be
genuine. It is else but a hot-house plant in a snow-storm—its
leaves torn off by the blast or shriveled in a
frosty embrace. I doubt much whether our intellectual
pleasures, as we proudly call them, are half as exhilarating,
and deeply steeped in genuine happiness, as were
those more animal sensations which we experienced when
boys, as we went hallooing and shouting along in the
very exuberance of our spirits, with a gay, glad, spirited
defiance of care and all its imps. This was the riches
of the heart and not of the pocket. Was it not? We had
no gold in those days, so it could not have been <span class='it'>that</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The February Number.</span>—Our number for the last
month has been pronounced, everywhere, the very best of
the Magazines for the month, and has thus far so largely
increased our sales, that we shall be obliged to issue a
very greatly increased edition of future numbers. The
year 1849 seems to have opened with most unparalleled
promises for magazine literature; and while our own sales
have augmented on all sides, we have the gratification, in
our good fortune, to feel that we are not impairing the
prosperity of our neighbors. Indeed, the Philadelphia
magazines, high as they have heretofore stood before the
country, and widely as they have been circulated, seem
just now to have made a bound in popular favor that
savors of romance. Fifteen or twenty thousand copies
of a monthly magazine was formerly regarded as the
highest point of success to enterprising publishers, and
ambitious editors, but the dawning of this brighter day
promises such results as a simple matter of <span class='it'>increase</span> on the
year’s business. We hope that our readers see, in the
growing improvement of “Graham,” a disposition to impart
a higher value to the book, as patronage increases,
and a careful catering to taste, which shows no falling off
in efforts to please, as well as to instruct our literary
household. Our <span class='it'>aim</span> has been to furnish our readers with
a work, in point of literary excellence, that is unsurpassable,
and in pictorial beauty at once chaste and elegant.
We could multiply, <span class='it'>ad infinitum</span>, second rate articles and
engravings, but we feel that we are consulting both the
reader’s taste and interest in adhering rigidly to the course
we have adopted, and we certainly have sufficient evidence
of its good policy, in the ample support we have
received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The March number may fairly challenge a rigid scrutiny,
and we invite a comparison between the literary
matter and that of the other magazines. The embellishments
are all most beautifully executed; but the plate of
“<span class='it'>Christ Weeping Over Jerusalem</span>” is a gem in the way of
engraving, and we refer to it with a conscious pride that
it can neither be successfully imitated nor excelled. Our
eyes linger over it with something like exultation, as we
present to our readers a plate of such exquisite beauty.

equal to its deserts, numbering <span class='it'>now</span> some sixty thousand

world, and is so widely and well known, that we
but endorse the general opinion, when we say that it is
one of the best Family journals in the nation. How the
enterprising publisher can furnish it at a dollar per annum

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
